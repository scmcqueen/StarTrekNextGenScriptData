68,GUL EVEK,   You don't think the fact that some   of the Maquis are former Starfleet   officers has anything to do with   it?,"""Preemptive Strike"""
69,PICARD,   Starfleet does not condone the   Maquis' actions in the   Demilitarized Zone.       Any more than your government   condones paramilitary actions by   Cardassian civilians.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
70,GUL EVEK,   We have taken measures to deal   with our colonists who have armed   themselves.,"""Preemptive Strike"""

79,PICARD,   You missed Gul Evek by a matter of   hours. I asked him to stay -- I   thought perhaps an admiral's   assurances would convince him that   we are trying to deal with the   Maquis situation.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
80,NECHAYEV,"       Evek manages to make the   Cardassians sound like helpless   sheep being preyed on by   Federation wolves. The truth is,   we caught the Cardassian   government supplying its colonies   in the Demilitarized Zone with   weapons.","""Preemptive Strike"""
81,PICARD,       Gul Evek assures me that practice   has stopped.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
82,NECHAYEV,   Ah. How comforting.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
83,PICARD,   Admiral... this Maquis situation   has you worried...,"""Preemptive Strike"""

87,NECHAYEV,"       But in the last few weeks we've   seen signs that the Maquis are   moving beyond self-defense. Their   ranks are growing... they've   acquired ships, weapons... they   seem to be preparing for a more   aggressive military posture.","""Preemptive Strike"""
88,NECHAYEV,       We have to put a stop to them...   before the entire Demilitarized   Zone ignites.       But before we can stop them -- we   have to find them.

89,PICARD,   Perhaps you need an undercover   operative.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
90,NECHAYEV,   Our thinking exactly. We intend   to infiltrate their organization.       And the person we want to do it is   aboard your ship right now.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
91,CUT TO:,,"""Preemptive Strike"""
92,RO,   Starfleet wants me to infiltrate   the Maquis?,"""Preemptive Strike"""
93,PICARD,   Because of your recent training...   because you're Bajoran... and   because of your past troubles with   Starfleet -- you'll have a certain   credibility.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
94,RO,"   Well, that's certainly true.","""Preemptive Strike"""
95,RO,       And just when would this mission   begin?,"""Preemptive Strike"""
96,PICARD,   Immediately.,"""Preemptive Strike"""

98,RO,       I've spent the better part of my   life fighting the Cardassians...   I never thought I'd be helping   them out.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
99,PICARD,   This is a rare case where our   interests coincide with theirs --   we both want peace in the   Demilitarized Zone.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
100,RO,   I've heard a lot about the Maquis.       One of my instructors in Tactical   Training... a Lieutenant Commander   in Starfleet -- a man I admired   and respectded... was sympathetic   to them. He resigned and left to   join them.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
101,PICARD,"   We're all sympathetic, Lieutenant.   Our civilian population in the   Demilitarized Zone is in a   difficult situation.       But sympathy ends at a certain   point. The peace treaty isn't   just a piece of paper. If the   Maquis force us into a war with   Cardassia, it could mean hundreds   of thousands of lives.","""Preemptive Strike"""
102,PICARD,"   Laren, two years ago, Starfleet   would never have tapped you for   this mission. They must have a   lot of confidence in you now.","""Preemptive Strike"""

111,SANTOS,   No.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
112,RO,   Nice meeting you --,"""Preemptive Strike"""
113,RO,       Thanks.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
114,SANTOS,   Did you kill that Cardassian?,"""Preemptive Strike"""
115,RO,   Starfleet thinks I did. That's   reason enough to hide.       Why did you tell them I'd left?,"""Preemptive Strike"""
116,SANTOS,   There are worse things a person   could do than kill a Cardassian   soldier.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
117,RO,   You don't often meet someone   willing to say that out loud.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
118,SANTOS,"   In the Zone, there are a lot of us   who feel that way.","""Preemptive Strike"""
119,RO,   I'd like to meet people like that.,"""Preemptive Strike"""

127,RO,   Ronara Prime.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
128,SANTOS,   Not anymore.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
129,RO,   Where am I then?,"""Preemptive Strike"""
130,KALITA,   We're not going to tell you that   until we know more about you.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
131,RO,   Like what?,"""Preemptive Strike"""
132,SANTOS,   Did you kill that Cardassian?,"""Preemptive Strike"""
133,RO,   Yes.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
134,KALITA,   That's a risky thing to do in the   Demilitarized Zone. You can end   up being hunted by Starfleet and   the Cardassians.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
135,RO,       Then... why did he risk bringing   me here?,"""Preemptive Strike"""
136,KALITA,   We're asking the questions. Who   are you?,"""Preemptive Strike"""
137,RO,   My name is Ro Laren. I grew up in   the Bajoran camps...,"""Preemptive Strike"""
138,MACIAS,   That would explain why you have no   love for Cardassians.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
139,RO,   I know what they're capable of.   They tortured my father to   death... and forced me to watch.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
140,SANTOS,   Where do you live now?,"""Preemptive Strike"""
141,RO,   Nowhere...       I was a Starfleet officer. But I   was court martialed and spent time   in the stockade on Jaros Two. I'm   not exactly what you'd call   Starfleet material.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
142,SANTOS,   When were you on Jaros?,"""Preemptive Strike"""
143,RO,   What difference does it make?,"""Preemptive Strike"""
144,KALITA,   We want to check your story. When   were you there?,"""Preemptive Strike"""
145,RO,   Starfleet let me out about three   years ago because I agreed to do   some work for them... mostly   having to do with Bajor. But I   got tired of watching them placate   the Cardassians and left.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
146,KALITA,   You resigned?,"""Preemptive Strike"""
147,RO,   Not officially.       That's part of the reason they're   looking for me.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
148,SANTOS,   What were you doing on Ronara?,"""Preemptive Strike"""
149,RO,"   Look, I've answered enough of your   questions -- I'd like to know who   you people are.","""Preemptive Strike"""
150,MACIAS,   Let's just say... we sympathize   with those who oppose Cardassia.,"""Preemptive Strike"""

157,MACIAS,       Come... let's stretch our legs.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
158,RO,   Aren't you taking a chance by   letting me see all this? What if   my story doesn't check out -- what   if I'm not who I say I am?,"""Preemptive Strike"""
159,MACIAS,"   Then we'll have a problem, won't   we?","""Preemptive Strike"""
160,RO,"   You are Maquis, aren't you?","""Preemptive Strike"""
161,MACIAS,   Many people here are.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
162,RO,   Starfleet considers you outlaws.   They're afraid you'll destroy the   peace treaty.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
163,MACIAS,   They don't understand the   situation here in the Zone.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
164,MACIAS,       I lived on Juhraya... the colony   suddenly found itself in   Cardassian territory when the   treaty was signed. Some of us   chose to stay and take our   chances.       One night I was dragged from my   bed and beaten. The authorities   clucked their tongues and agreed   it was an unfortunate incident...   and did nothing.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
165,RO,   I'm not surprised. The   Cardassians intend to make life so   unpleasant for Federation citizens   that they'll leave.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
166,MACIAS,   Exactly. And no one seems to see   that except the Maquis.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
167,MACIAS,       How old were you when your father   was killed?,"""Preemptive Strike"""
168,RO,   I'd rather not talk about it.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
169,MACIAS,   Are you hungry? Would you like   something?,"""Preemptive Strike"""
170,RO,   No. Thank you.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
171,MACIAS,       Hasperat.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
172,RO,       You like hasperat?,"""Preemptive Strike"""
173,MACIAS,   An old Bajoran friend of mine used   to make it. Although his was much   stronger.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
174,MACIAS,   He died years ago... fighting the   Cardassian occupation of Bajor...   I miss his company... and his   hasperat...,"""Preemptive Strike"""
175,RO,   My father made the strongest   hasperat you've ever tasted.   Everything else seems mild by   comparison.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
176,MACIAS,   Did he teach you how to make it?,"""Preemptive Strike"""
177,RO,   Yes. But I haven't tried it in   years.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
178,MACIAS,"       If you would make the brine for   truly strong hasperat -- and I   mean eye-watering, tongue-searing   strong -- you would make an old   man very happy.","""Preemptive Strike"""
179,RO,   I'd enjoy making it again.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
180,SANTOS ,   Macias...,"""Preemptive Strike"""
181,SANTOS,   I checked with my sources at   Starfleet...       Her story's true.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
182,MACIAS,   I was sure it was.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
183,MACIAS,       Kalita -- she'll stay with you   until we can find her a room.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
184,SANTOS,   Why aren't you with the others?,"""Preemptive Strike"""
185,RO,   Kalita told me to stay here -- she   had things to do.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
186,SANTOS,   You've been here a week and she   still doesn't trust you.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
187,SANTOS,       We're meeting to discuss   strategy...,"""Preemptive Strike"""
188,RO,"   So that's what she meant by   ""things to do."" Kalita reminds   me of someone I knew during the   occupation... being a part of the   resistance was the only thing he   cared about. It was his identity.","""Preemptive Strike"""
189,SANTOS,   That does sound like Kalita...,"""Preemptive Strike"""
190,RO,"   Don't get me wrong, I was glad to   have him on my side... but he was   hard to be around.       Sometimes people would stay up   late... telling stories -- you   know, trying to forget about our   troubles for a while. Kanore   would come out of his tent in a   huff and tell everyone to be quiet --   that we should get some rest so   we'd have ""strength for our   struggle.""","""Preemptive Strike"""
191,SANTOS,   What would people do?,"""Preemptive Strike"""

195,MACIAS,   Ah... there you are.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
196,KALITA,       We've just heard a disturbing   rumor.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
197,RO,   Another rumor?,"""Preemptive Strike"""
198,KALITA,   One that I think we should take   seriously. A trader coming from   Pendi Two said he could verify   that the Cardassians are going to   start supplying their colonists   with bio-genic weapons.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
199,RO,   I thought every shipment coming   into the Zone was searched...,"""Preemptive Strike"""
200,KALITA,    (scoffing at her     naivete)   The Cardassians always seem to   find a way to get around problems   like that.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
201,SANTOS,   We have to make a preemptive   strike. Send a message to   Cardassia that we won't sit still   and let them kill us with toxins.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
202,MACIAS,   Agreed. But we can't mount a   strike without medical supplies --   and our stockpile is dangerously   low.,"""Preemptive Strike"""

204,RO,   I can get medical supplies.,"""Preemptive Strike"""

216,RO,   I could use an extra hand at the   controls. And a witness.,"""Preemptive Strike"""
