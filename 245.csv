266,GEORDI,   The fire storms can kick up winds   of over two hundred kilometers per   hour -- and temperatures as high   as three hundred degrees C.,"""Lessons"""
267,BEVERLY,   Incredible... what causes them?,"""Lessons"""
268,NELLA,   They form when solar flare   radiation from the Bersallin sun   reacts with high energy plasma   present in the planet's   atmosphere.,"""Lessons"""
269,BEVERLY,   Wasn't the outpost built to   withstand the conditions?,"""Lessons"""
270,GEORDI,   Yes; the structure is reinforced   and insulated. But this is no   ordinary storm; it's twice as big   as any they've ever had. The   outpost won't withstand it.,"""Lessons"""
271,RIKER,   We'll be arriving a little over an   hour before the storm hits.       It'll take at least two hours to   transport all the colonists off   the surface.,"""Lessons"""
272,NELLA,   I led a team of geologists to   study the plasma geyser on Taurus   Four -- we cross-connected a few   thermal deflector units to create   a protective shield against the   heat.,"""Lessons"""

275,GEORDI,   It might.,"""Lessons"""
276,GEORDI,"   The storm is approaching the   outpost from this direction.       If we set up a series of thermal   deflector units along the northern   perimeter, we could create a fire   wall to deflect some of the heat --   the outpost's insulation could   probably handle the rest.","""Lessons"""
277,DATA,   Thermal deflectors generate a   field approximately four hundred   meters wide. We would need to   cross-connect six units and align   them so their fields overlap.,"""Lessons"""
278,RIKER,   How many people would it take to   set it up?,"""Lessons"""
279,GEORDI,"   Twelve, two per team. Cross-connecting   that many units will be   tricky; once they're set up we'll   have to leave them in place and   transport our people out -- no one   could survive very long outside   the outpost.","""Lessons"""

282,RIKER,"       Mister Data, you'll coordinate the   evacuation of the colonists.       Doctor, they have nine patients in   the outpost infirmary. Your   priority will be getting them to   Sickbay -- after that you'll stay   aboard the Enterprise and be ready   to receive casualties.
