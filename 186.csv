0,PICARD ,   Captain's log: Stardate 44429.6.   We are on a mapping survey near   the Cardassian sector. It has   been nearly a year since a peace   treaty ended the long conflict   between the Federation and   Cardassia.,"""The Wounded"""
1,DATA,"   Captain, we are nearing the   periphery of Sector   twenty-one-five-oh-three.","""The Wounded"""
2,PICARD,"   Be on the lookout for a Cardassian   patrol vessel, Mister Worf.   They should be hailing us soon.","""The Wounded"""
3,RIKER,"   Even with a treaty, they're   skittish about protecting their   borders.","""The Wounded"""
4,PICARD,"   Last time I was in this sector,   I was on the Stargazer, running   at warp speed ahead of a   Cardassian warship.","""The Wounded"""
5,TROI,"       Running, Captain? You? That's   hard to believe...","""The Wounded"""
6,PICARD,   Believe it. I'd been sent to make   preliminary overtures to a   truce... I lowered my shields as   a gesture of good will. But the   Cardassians weren't impressed.   They took out most of my weapons   and damaged the impulse engines   before I could regroup and run.,"""The Wounded"""
7,WORF,   The Cardassians have no honor.   I do not trust them.,"""The Wounded"""
8,TROI,"   They're our allies now, Worf.   We have to trust them.","""The Wounded"""
9,WORF,"   Trust is earned, not given away.","""The Wounded"""
10,PICARD,"   Well, I hope their scout vessel   makes contact soon. It's not a   good idea to stay too long on a   Cardassian border without making   your intentions known.","""The Wounded"""

12,O'BRIEN,       What is it?,"""The Wounded"""

16,O'BRIEN,   No oatmeal -- or muffins? How   about corned beef and eggs?,"""The Wounded"""
17,KEIKO,   For breakfast?,"""The Wounded"""
18,O'BRIEN,"       Keiko, I've been thinking...   You've introduced me to all the   wonderful foods you're accustomed   to... I'd like to do the same.       Isn't that what marriage is about?   Sharing?","""The Wounded"""
19,KEIKO,   Like what kind of food?,"""The Wounded"""

23,KEIKO,   She cooked?,"""The Wounded"""
24,O'BRIEN,   She didn't believe in a   replicator. She thought real food   was more nutritious.,"""The Wounded"""
25,KEIKO,       She handled... real meat...   touched it and cut it?,"""The Wounded"""
26,O'BRIEN,"   Like a chef. She was fantastic.   Of course, I'll have to use the   replicator... but I'll make   something special for you tonight.   You'll love it, I promise.","""The Wounded"""
27,KEIKO,"   Okay. Maybe I'll have something   special for you, tonight, too...","""The Wounded"""

48,MACET,   I am Gul Macet of the Cardassian   ship Trager.,"""The Wounded"""
49,PICARD,   Why have you fired on us?,"""The Wounded"""
50,MACET,"   A curious question. In war, one   attacks one's enemies.","""The Wounded"""
51,PICARD,       There is a treaty between our   people...,"""The Wounded"""
52,MACET,   Perhaps that fact was unknown to   the Federation starship which   destroyed our space station in   the Cuellar System two days ago.,"""The Wounded"""
53,PICARD,   A Federation starship... ?,"""The Wounded"""
54,MACET,   Attacked an unarmed science   station. They had barely enough   time to send an emergency   signal... before they were   incinerated.,"""The Wounded"""
55,PICARD,   Gul Macet... the Federation and   the Cardassians have struggled   too hard for peace to abandon it   so easily...,"""The Wounded"""
56,MACET,"   We are not the ones who   abandoned it, Captain.","""The Wounded"""
57,PICARD,"   Let me talk to my superiors...   find out what's behind this.   Give me one hour. The alternative   is for us to continue firing at   each other. In such a contest,   you would be at a disadvantage.","""The Wounded"""
58,MACET,   Very well. One hour.,"""The Wounded"""
59,ADMIRAL HADEN,"   We've confirmed the report,   Captain. It was the starship   Phoenix... under the command of   Benjamin Maxwell.","""The Wounded"""
60,PICARD,   Ben Maxwell... he's one of   Starfleet's finest Captains...   he must have had provocation.,"""The Wounded"""
61,ADMIRAL HADEN,   I wish we knew. He's gone on   silent running... doesn't answer   our communiques.,"""The Wounded"""
62,PICARD,   Then he's still in Cardassian   space.,"""The Wounded"""
63,ADMIRAL HADEN,       The station he destroyed was in   sector twenty-one-five-oh-five   -- you're the nearest starship.   We want you to go in and find   him.,"""The Wounded"""
64,PICARD,   Will the Cardassians   cooperate... ?,"""The Wounded"""
65,ADMIRAL HADEN,   They've granted you safe   passage... We've agreed that   you'll take along a delegation   of observers as a show of good   faith.       Jean-Luc... I don't have to tell   you the Federation is not prepared   for a new sustained conflict. You   must preserve the peace... no   matter what the cost. Haden out.,"""The Wounded"""
66,PICARD,"   ... there will be three Cardassians   transporting on board... Their   Captain, Gul Macet and two of his   aides.       My intention is to be as open as   possible with them... allow them   to share in our search for the   Phoenix.","""The Wounded"""
67,WORF,"   Sir, it is necessary to assign   them a security detail.","""The Wounded"""
68,PICARD,"   They will be our guests, Mister   Worf. I don't want them to feel   like prisoners.","""The Wounded"""
69,RIKER,"   I'm inclined to agree with Worf,   Captain. I would limit their   access while they're on board.   They don't need the run of the   ship.","""The Wounded"""
70,PICARD,   I understand your concerns. And   I realize... that we have had   a long and difficult history with   the Cardassians.,"""The Wounded"""
71,PICARD,   However... it is not an   exaggeration to say that the   difference between peace... and   war... is up to us. And the way   we treat the Cardassians may make   the difference.,"""The Wounded"""
72,WORF,   At least let me post guards at   some of the sensitive areas of   the ship.,"""The Wounded"""
73,PICARD,"       Very well, we will limit their   access. But instruct your   people... they are guests.","""The Wounded"""

80,O'BRIEN,"   The delegation is ready to come   aboard, sir.","""The Wounded"""
81,RIKER,   I believe you served under   Benjamin Maxwell?,"""The Wounded"""
82,O'BRIEN,   Captain Maxwell? I'm proud to   say I did.,"""The Wounded"""
83,RIKER,   It seems Maxwell has taken it   upon himself to destroy a   Cardassian space station.,"""The Wounded"""
84,O'BRIEN,"   If that's true, sir, there was   a reason for it. I'd bank my life   on that.","""The Wounded"""
85,RIKER,   The Captain may want to talk to   you about him.       Bring them aboard.,"""The Wounded"""
86,RIKER,   Welcome to the Enterprise. I am   First Officer William Riker...   this is Counselor Deanna Troi.,"""The Wounded"""

91,RIKER,   We are scanning Sector   twenty-one-five-oh-five now. So   far... no sign of the Phoenix.,"""The Wounded"""
92,MACET,"       In fact, you have no assurance   that the ship is still in Sector   twenty-one-five-oh-five.","""The Wounded"""
93,RIKER,"       In fact, we don't have any idea   where it is. But the last known   co-ordinates seemed like a   reasonably good place to start.","""The Wounded"""
94,PICARD,    (jumping in to keep it     smooth)   We would welcome any additional   intelligence your forces could   provide.,"""The Wounded"""
95,MACET,   Captain Picard... you can   understand that we are skeptical.   Do you expect us to believe that   you are using every means at your   disposal -- to track down one of   your own?,"""The Wounded"""
96,PICARD,"   Of course you would have concerns,   Gul Macet. It is precisely   because of that fact that I am   including you in every aspect of   our effort.       You are here, with my staff,   hearing reports as I hear them.   Nothing is edited... nothing   withheld.","""The Wounded"""
97,PICARD,   Please. Let us continue.,"""The Wounded"""
98,MACET,   Very well.,"""The Wounded"""
99,PICARD,"   Our Transporter Chief, Mister   O'Brien, has served with Benjamin   Maxwell. I thought he might   provide some insights.","""The Wounded"""
100,PICARD,   Mister O'Brien... I believe   Captain Maxwell lost his family...   during a raid on an outpost.,"""The Wounded"""
101,O'BRIEN,"   More like sabotage, sir. It was   on Setlik Three. A squad of   Cardassian militia made a sneak   attack on an outpost... wiped out   close to a hundred civilians.","""The Wounded"""
102,MACET,   Then it's vengeance he's after.,"""The Wounded"""
103,O'BRIEN,   That's not what I meant --,"""The Wounded"""
104,MACET,   Maxwell's taking retribution for   his own loss.,"""The Wounded"""
105,O'BRIEN,       Captain Maxwell would never --,"""The Wounded"""
106,PICARD,"   Gentlemen, please. Let us avoid   speculation, and confine this   discussion to facts. Now, Mister   O'Brien --","""The Wounded"""
107,WORF,   Worf to Captain Picard.,"""The Wounded"""
108,PICARD,"       Yes, Lieutenant.","""The Wounded"""
109,WORF,   Captain -- long range sensors have   located the Phoenix.,"""The Wounded"""
110,PICARD,   Will you join me on the Bridge?,"""The Wounded"""
111,O'BRIEN,   Deck six.,"""The Wounded"""
112,DARO,   Deck ten.,"""The Wounded"""
113,DARO,   Your Captain is most impressive.,"""The Wounded"""
114,O'BRIEN,   Yes. He is.,"""The Wounded"""
115,DARO,   Chief O'Brien... our Transporting   system is still operating with   active feed pattern buffers. I   would like to talk with you about   your technology.,"""The Wounded"""
116,O'BRIEN,   I'll have to get Commander   La Forge's approval on that.,"""The Wounded"""
117,DARO,   I understand. In the meantime...   we're going to your Ten-Forward.   Will you join us?,"""The Wounded"""
118,O'BRIEN,"   If my commander tells me to   discuss the Transporter with you,   I will. If Captain Picard orders   me to tell you everything I know   about Ben Maxwell, I will.","""The Wounded"""
119,O'BRIEN,   But who I choose to spend my free   time with... that's my business.,"""The Wounded"""
120,DATA,   We have located the Phoenix in   Sector twenty-one-five-oh-five.,"""The Wounded"""
121,PICARD,"   Ensign, set a course -- warp six.   Mister Worf, send a message by   sub-space. Tell them to prepare   to rendezvous with us.","""The Wounded"""
122,WORF,"   Yes, Captain.","""The Wounded"""
123,MACET,   Captain... a suggestion.,"""The Wounded"""
124,PICARD,   Yes?,"""The Wounded"""
125,MACET,   We have a number of ships in   sector twenty-one-five-oh-five.   If you give us more precise   coordinates... and the ship's   coded transponder frequency...   we could intercept Maxwell much   more quickly than you.,"""The Wounded"""
126,PICARD,"   I'm sure that's true. However,   given the circumstances, I'd   prefer to make the initial contact   myself. As I'm sure you would   if the situation were reversed.","""The Wounded"""
127,MACET,"   Time is crucial. You have a   dangerous man out there, with a   huge arsenal at his command. If   he's bent on revenge against my   people... he must be stopped   before he can do more damage.","""The Wounded"""
128,PICARD,"   At the moment, we have an isolated   incident. If I reach him first,   diplomatic efforts can still   prevail.       But if one of your ships decides   to retaliate against the   Phoenix... we risk losing control   of the situation.","""The Wounded"""
129,MACET,   Then you won't give us the means   of finding his exact location?,"""The Wounded"""
130,PICARD,   No. I will not.,"""The Wounded"""
131,O'BRIEN,   There you are... potato casserole   -- a dish fit for kings.,"""The Wounded"""
132,O'BRIEN,   ... minstrel boy to the war is gone...    ,"""The Wounded"""
133,KEIKO,   What's that you're singing?,"""The Wounded"""
134,O'BRIEN,   What? Oh... just an old song...,"""The Wounded"""
135,O'BRIEN,   A bunch of us used to sing it   together... on the Rutledge.   I haven't thought about it for   years...,"""The Wounded"""
136,KEIKO,   What's it about?,"""The Wounded"""
137,O'BRIEN,"   Oh... about war, and glory...       ""The minstrel boy to the war is gone;   In the ranks of death you'll find him;   His father's sword he hath girded on;   And his wild harp slung behind him.""       ... Captain Maxwell always liked   that song...       I guess all this business with   him and the Cardassians... brought   it back.","""The Wounded"""
138,O'BRIEN,"   You know... sitting with the   staff this morning, I could   tell there were people in that   room who still don't like the   Cardassians.","""The Wounded"""
139,KEIKO,   I imagine that's to be expected...,"""The Wounded"""
140,O'BRIEN,   You do?,"""The Wounded"""
141,KEIKO,   The war lasted a long time. That   takes its toll on people. What   are these little black things?,"""The Wounded"""
142,O'BRIEN,   Capers. But the fighting is over   now. Why would anyone still   feel... however they feel?,"""The Wounded"""
143,KEIKO,   Maybe it's not that easy for some   people to forget.,"""The Wounded"""
144,O'BRIEN,   I'm... trying to understand. The   people who hang onto -- grudges.   Seems to me they ought to be able   to put those feelings aside...   once the fighting's done with.,"""The Wounded"""
145,KEIKO,"   That may be harder to do than to   say.       You fought the Cardassians, didn't   you?","""The Wounded"""
146,O'BRIEN,   There were some skirmishes... when   I was with Captain Maxwell.,"""The Wounded"""
147,KEIKO,   Well... how do you feel about   them?,"""The Wounded"""
148,O'BRIEN,   Me? I feel... fine. I mean...   the war's over now.,"""The Wounded"""
149,O'BRIEN,   Tomorrow night... kidney pie.   And then maybe pot roast... beef   tongue...,"""The Wounded"""
150,PICARD,   The pursuing ship is the Phoenix.,"""The Wounded"""
151,MACET,   And the other?,"""The Wounded"""
152,DATA,   We believe it to be a Cardassian   supply ship.,"""The Wounded"""
153,MACET,   How would you know that?,"""The Wounded"""
154,PICARD,   We... are able to make that   determination.,"""The Wounded"""
155,MACET,   You can read our transponder   codes!,"""The Wounded"""
156,PICARD,   What is important at the moment   is that your ship may be in   jeopardy. Mister Worf -- any   answer to our communications?,"""The Wounded"""
157,WORF,"   No, Captain.","""The Wounded"""
158,PICARD,"   Put a repeating message on all   sub-space channels. Make it a   Priority One communique -- break   off pursuit immediately.       Gul Macet... as you can see, we   are doing everything in our power   to reach the Phoenix.","""The Wounded"""
159,MACET,   And accomplishing nothing.       Can you show me the location of   our other ships?,"""The Wounded"""
160,PICARD,   Mister Data.,"""The Wounded"""
161,MACET,   You see... we have a warship which   could intercept the Phoenix before   it's too late. If you will give   us the transponder frequency.,"""The Wounded"""
162,MACET ,   Or are you going to stand and   watch while our ship is destroyed?,"""The Wounded"""
163,PICARD,   Mister Worf -- has there been any   response to our hails?,"""The Wounded"""
164,WORF,"   No, sir.","""The Wounded"""
165,PICARD,   Very well... prepare to relay the   transponder code of the Phoenix   to the Cardassian warship.,"""The Wounded"""
166,WORF,   Sir -- ?,"""The Wounded"""
167,PICARD,   And then send a message to Captain   Maxwell... advise him that we   have relayed his location to the   Cardassians.,"""The Wounded"""
168,RIKER,"   Begging your pardon, Captain...   the transponder code will allow   them to track all our ships.","""The Wounded"""
169,PICARD,   I'm aware of that. Mister Worf   -- any response from the Phoenix?,"""The Wounded"""
170,WORF,"   No, Captain.","""The Wounded"""
171,PICARD,"   Mister Data, any change in their   their course?","""The Wounded"""
172,DATA,   Nossir. The Phoenix is   continuing on its bearing   toward the supply ship.,"""The Wounded"""

174,WORF,"       Sir, they'll be able to dismantle   its shields! The Phoenix won't   have a chance.","""The Wounded"""

179,DATA,   The warship is three hundred   thousand kilometers from the   Phoenix. It is opening fire.   The Phoenix has taken a direct   hit.,"""The Wounded"""
180,DATA,   The Phoenix is beginning evasive   maneuvers.       It has positioned itself outside   the weapons range of the opposing   ship.       The Phoenix has powered up with   both phasers and photon   torpedoes.       The Phoenix is firing photon   torpedoes.,"""The Wounded"""

194,PICARD,   Then... from your knowledge of   the man... what has gone wrong?,"""The Wounded"""
195,O'BRIEN,"       There's a reason for what he's   doing. Those Cardassians were   up to something, I'm sure of it.","""The Wounded"""
196,PICARD,   How did he take it... when his   family was killed?,"""The Wounded"""
197,O'BRIEN,"   I'd say he took it well. Oh, I   know he was broken up inside...   who wouldn't be? But you'd never   know it to see him. He never   missed a minute's duty, always   had a smile and a joke...","""The Wounded"""
198,PICARD,   I see...,"""The Wounded"""
199,O'BRIEN,"   And Captain Maxwell, he'd never   retaliate out of vengeance, no   matter what that Cardassian says.   They're up to something...   they're the ones you should be   investigating, sir, not Captain   Maxwell.","""The Wounded"""
200,PICARD,   You don't care for the   Cardassians...,"""The Wounded"""

204,PICARD,"   I think... when one has been angry   for a very long time... one gets   used to it. Then it becomes   comfortable... like old leather.
