25,TROI,   You've been moving from starship   to starship since Clara was two   years old. Maybe Isabella   provides a constant companion for   Clara. She knows this is one   friend she won't have to leave   behind.,"""Imaginary Friend"""
26,SUTTER,   You're probably right.,"""Imaginary Friend"""

154,SUTTER,   But... it must have been   disruptive if you didn't stay   in one place long enough to make   friends...,"""Imaginary Friend"""
155,GEORDI,"   I guess there were things about   my childhood that weren't ideal...   but to me, it was like one long   adventure.       Kids are tougher than you think.   As long as they know you love   them... they can handle just   about anything life throws at   them.","""Imaginary Friend"""

161,GUINAN,       Right there -- see how the two   swirls come up to form a mast...,"""Imaginary Friend"""
162,DATA,   I do not see it.       It is interesting that people try   to find meaningful patterns in   things that are essentially   random. I have noticed that the   images they perceive can sometimes   suggest what they are thinking   about at that particular moment.,"""Imaginary Friend"""

174,GUINAN,"   Oh, no?","""Imaginary Friend"""
175,CLARA,   They don't think Isabella's real.,"""Imaginary Friend"""
176,GUINAN,   Sometimes grown-ups have a tough   time believing in things they   can't see.,"""Imaginary Friend"""
177,CLARA,   Why?,"""Imaginary Friend"""
178,GUINAN,   Well... they tend to get very   preoccupied with grown-up things.,"""Imaginary Friend"""
179,CLARA,   Like what?,"""Imaginary Friend"""
180,GUINAN,"   Oh... like figuring out how much   fuel it takes to power this   ship... or deciding whether to   explore one star system or   another... arranging schedules,   making lists, counting inventory,   or... wondering if little girls   should go to bed at seven... or be   allowed to stay up till eight.","""Imaginary Friend"""
181,GUINAN,   Their heads can get so full...   that there's no room left for the   things you and I know are important.   Like invisible friends.,"""Imaginary Friend"""

190,CLARA,   Sounds scary.,"""Imaginary Friend"""
191,GUINAN,   It was... especially when it   smiled.,"""Imaginary Friend"""
192,GUINAN,"   But the best thing about it was   that I could curl up and lie on   its furry stomach. It had the   deepest, softest purr you've ever   heard... it put me to sleep   every night...       That razor beast was a good   friend.","""Imaginary Friend"""
