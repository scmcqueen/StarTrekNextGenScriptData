7,GI'RAL,   The Romulan Commander -- Tokath--   thought he was being kind.,"""Birthright, Part II"""
8,L'KOR,   The Romulans hoped to trade our   lives for territorial concessions.   But the Klingon High Council   refused to negotiate.       They would not acknowledge their   warriors had been taken prisoner.,"""Birthright, Part II"""
