0,PICARD ,"   Captain's Log, Stardate 47410.2.   The Atrean government has   requested assistance in averting   a natural disaster that is   threatening their world. Two of   their geologists have come aboard   to discuss the problem, one of   whom is a human who has been   living on Atrea Four.","""Inheritance"""
1,JULIANA,"   Captain, our situation has   worsened since my husband and I   first contacted you. The molten   core of our planet is not just   cooling -- it's begun to solidify.","""Inheritance"""
2,PRAN,   Our gravitational field has been   affected -- seismic activity has   increased by a factor of three.,"""Inheritance"""
3,JULIANA,   If the cooling continues at this   rate -- Atrea will become   uninhabitable within thirteen   months.,"""Inheritance"""
4,GEORDI,   We could minimize seismic activity   by creating isobaric fissures and   releasing some of the tectonic   stress -- but that would just be   a temporary fix.,"""Inheritance"""
5,DATA,   The only permanent solution would   be to re-liquefy the core.,"""Inheritance"""
6,GEORDI,   These pockets in the magma layer --   how close are they to the molten   region of the core?,"""Inheritance"""
7,JULIANA,"   A few kilometers, why?","""Inheritance"""
8,GEORDI,   You think that's close enough to   try ferro-plasmic infusion?,"""Inheritance"""
9,DATA,   The procedure would involve using   our ship's phasers to drill down   through the planet's surface and   into the pockets -- where we would   set up a series of plasma infusion   units.,"""Inheritance"""
10,GEORDI,   We'd trigger the units by firing   a modulated energy burst down   through the shafts.,"""Inheritance"""
11,JULIANA,   I see... injecting sufficient   plasma directly into the core   should trigger a chain reaction...   and that will reliquify the   magma...,"""Inheritance"""
12,DATA,   It should be possible to stabilize   the core temperature at ninety-three   percent of normal.,"""Inheritance"""
13,PRAN,"   If it works, the core would remain   molten for centuries.","""Inheritance"""
14,PICARD,"   If you give your permission, we'll   begin immediately.","""Inheritance"""
15,PRAN,"   Very well. But before we proceed,   I'd like to update our geological   surveys.","""Inheritance"""
16,GEORDI,"   I'll be glad to help you, Doctor.","""Inheritance"""
17,PICARD,       I've assigned you quarters during   the time we're here. Please make   yourselves comfortable.,"""Inheritance"""

21,JULIANA,   Do you have any idea who I am?,"""Inheritance"""
22,DATA,   You are Doctor Juliana Tainer.,"""Inheritance"""
23,JULIANA,   You lost all your early memories.   We thought you would -- but we   couldn't know for certain.,"""Inheritance"""
24,DATA,   Have we met before?,"""Inheritance"""
25,JULIANA,"   Oh, Data, I was there -- right   from the beginning, on Omicron   Theta. I helped create you.       And now... look at you.","""Inheritance"""
26,DATA,       You were a colleague of Doctor   Soong?,"""Inheritance"""
27,JULIANA,"   Yes, I certainly was -- and I was   also his wife. In a way, I   suppose you could say -- I'm your   mother.","""Inheritance"""
28,JULIANA,   I still can't believe it... seeing   you again after all these years...,"""Inheritance"""
29,DATA,"   Doctor, I have no memory of you.","""Inheritance"""
30,JULIANA,   There's a reason for that... we   wiped your processors after we'd   finished refining your   programming.,"""Inheritance"""
31,JULIANA,       Why don't you tell me what you do   remember... and then I'll fill in   the gaps.,"""Inheritance"""
32,DATA,       My memory record begins when I was   activated by the Starfleet   officers who found me on the   Omicron Theta outpost.,"""Inheritance"""
33,JULIANA,   After the attack by the   Crystalline Entity --,"""Inheritance"""
34,DATA,   Yes. All of the inhabitants of   the colony had been killed.,"""Inheritance"""
35,DATA,   But -- I discovered that my memory   banks contained the contents of   their journals and logs.,"""Inheritance"""
36,JULIANA,"       We thought you might find their   experiences useful... after your   childhood, we figured you needed   all the help you could get.","""Inheritance"""
37,DATA,   My -- childhood?,"""Inheritance"""
38,JULIANA,"       That's what I called it. You were   like a baby at first -- a hundred   kilogram baby, but still...","""Inheritance"""
39,JULIANA,"       It took you a while to develop   motor skills... learn how to   process sensory information. And   of course Noonian was never   satisfied... he kept tinkering,   trying to make you as human as   possible. And then there was the   business about hiccuping...","""Inheritance"""
40,DATA,   Hiccuping?,"""Inheritance"""
41,JULIANA,"   He was determined that you'd have   periodic bouts of hiccups, but he   couldn't get it right -- they were   either too violent, or too   prolonged, or not noticeable at   all... I finally said, good   heavens, Noonian -- nobody likes   having hiccups. Why don't you   just forget it? So he did.","""Inheritance"""
42,DATA,   So you wiped my memory processors   after this -- childhood.,"""Inheritance"""
43,JULIANA,   Then we deactivated you -- and   programmed you with the colonists'   logs. We were planning to reactivate   you.       But we never had the chance. The   Crystalline Entity attacked... we   had to leave quickly. We wanted   to bring you with us -- but there   was only room for two in the   escape pod.,"""Inheritance"""
44,DATA,"   Doctor, I have scanned the   colonists' journals... there is   only one Juliana mentioned in   them, and her last name is   O'Donnell.","""Inheritance"""
45,JULIANA,   That's me...,"""Inheritance"""
46,DATA,   But there is no mention that my   father was married to you.,"""Inheritance"""
47,JULIANA,   Because of my mother.       She thought Noonian was an   eccentric scientist who was too   old for me... we decided to get   married secretly and give her some   time to get used to the idea of   our being together.,"""Inheritance"""
48,JULIANA,       We slipped away to Mavala Four and   got married there... a Klingon and   a Corvallan trader were our   witnesses...     ,"""Inheritance"""
49,,,"""Inheritance"""
50,JULIANA ,"       It wasn't exactly the wedding I'd   hoped for, but Noonian had a way   of making the oddest things seem   romantic...","""Inheritance"""
51,DATA,   My father did have an unusual way   of looking at things...,"""Inheritance"""
52,JULIANA,       How would you know that?,"""Inheritance"""
53,DATA,   I encountered him once -- in the   Terlina system.,"""Inheritance"""
54,JULIANA,       That's where we went -- after we   left the outpost... I had no idea   you'd ever met him.,"""Inheritance"""
55,DATA,   It was shortly before his death.,"""Inheritance"""
56,JULIANA,   He's... dead?,"""Inheritance"""
57,DATA,   Yes.,"""Inheritance"""
58,JULIANA,"   I didn't think it would hit me   this hard...    (beat, struggling for     control)   We didn't exactly part on the best   of terms...","""Inheritance"""
59,DATA,   What do you mean?,"""Inheritance"""
60,JULIANA,"   I realized that he loved his work   as much as he loved me. Maybe   more. There we were, stuck on   that planet in the middle of a   jungle... no one else to talk to,   no -- no life. It just wasn't   enough...       That's why I left.","""Inheritance"""
61,JULIANA,"       Anyway, it was a long time ago.   What's important is that we're   together now.","""Inheritance"""
62,JULIANA,       And I want to get to know you.,"""Inheritance"""
63,DATA,"   This has been an interesting   encounter, and one altogether   unexpected. I would like to   corroborate what you have told me   before we proceed further.","""Inheritance"""
64,DATA,"   Excuse me, Doctor.","""Inheritance"""
65,GEORDI,   I'm just about finished   reconfiguring the phaser banks.   We should be ready to start   drilling in about an hour.,"""Inheritance"""
66,DATA,   Inform me when you are ready.,"""Inheritance"""
67,GEORDI,"   What are you doing there, anyway?","""Inheritance"""
68,DATA,   I am attempting to ascertain   whether Doctor Tainer's story is   true.,"""Inheritance"""
69,GEORDI,   Don't you believe her?,"""Inheritance"""
70,DATA,   I neither doubt nor believe her.   I am simply attempting to verify   her assertions.,"""Inheritance"""
71,GEORDI,"   Well, what have you turned up so   far?","""Inheritance"""
72,DATA,   The Registrar's Office on Mavala   Four cannot confirm that Doctor   Soong was married there.     ,"""Inheritance"""
73,,,"""Inheritance"""
74,DATA ,   Apparently many documents were   lost when the government was   overthrown.,"""Inheritance"""
75,GEORDI,   Then what are you looking at?,"""Inheritance"""
76,DATA,   I am checking passenger manifests   to see if they went to Mavala   during the period in question.,"""Inheritance"""
77,DATA,"   O'Donnell, Juliana...       Soong, Noonian -- they were both   passengers on a transport that   travelled from Omicron Theta to   Mavala... and returned four days   later.","""Inheritance"""
78,GEORDI,   That sure seems to fit her story.,"""Inheritance"""
79,DATA,"   Still, the fact that they went to   Mavala does not prove they were   married there.","""Inheritance"""
80,GEORDI,"   You know, Data... I almost get the   feeling you're trying to prove   that Doctor Tainer wasn't telling   the truth.","""Inheritance"""
81,DATA,   Not at all. I am merely unable to   reconcile her story with the fact   that my father never mentioned her   to me.,"""Inheritance"""
82,GEORDI,"   Well, she did leave him. Maybe   she broke his heart. Maybe he   just didn't want to talk about   her...","""Inheritance"""
83,GEORDI,       And let me ask you this... Doctor   Soong created an emotion chip for   you... didn't Lore tell you it   also contained memories --   memories Soong wanted you to have?,"""Inheritance"""
84,DATA,   Yes.       It is possible that those are the   memories of my childhood. And of   my mother.,"""Inheritance"""
85,GEORDI,   And if you think about it -- why   would she lie? Why would someone   pretend to be your mother?,"""Inheritance"""
86,DATA,   I can think of no motive for such   a pretense.,"""Inheritance"""
87,GEORDI,   I can understand why you might be   a little disconcerted by all   this... it came out of the   blue... and the story doesn't fit   neatly into your logical   processors.,"""Inheritance"""
88,DATA,   That is true...,"""Inheritance"""
89,GEORDI,"   But that's life, Data. Part of   being human is learning to handle   the unexpected... to risk new   experiences even when they don't   fit your preconceptions.","""Inheritance"""
90,DATA,   I will admit that it is difficult   for me to accept the possibility   of a past about which I know   nothing...       But it is also true that I am very   curious to learn more about it.,"""Inheritance"""
91,JULIANA,       Data...,"""Inheritance"""
92,DATA,   I would like to get to know you.       Mother.,"""Inheritance"""
93,JULIANA,"   -- I wanted to make you female,   but your father insisted on a son.   We argued about it endlessly,   right up until we were ready to   assemble you.","""Inheritance"""
94,DATA,       How did you decide?,"""Inheritance"""
95,JULIANA,"   Well, Noonian walked in holding   your head in his hand and --   innocent as you please -- said it   was up to me. Of course he knew   perfectly well what he was   doing... once again, he'd made it   in his own image -- what was I to   say?","""Inheritance"""
96,JULIANA,       Deanna Troi... is this who you're   going to visit?,"""Inheritance"""
97,DATA,   Yes.,"""Inheritance"""
98,JULIANA,   Your father would be so pleased.,"""Inheritance"""
99,DATA,   Pleased?,"""Inheritance"""
100,JULIANA,   He was worried the sexuality   programming he designed for you   wouldn't work...,"""Inheritance"""

102,JULIANA,       Good night...,"""Inheritance"""
103,DATA,   Doctor Tainer has provided me with   many details about my development   that I was not aware of.   Conversing with her was a   fascinating experience --,"""Inheritance"""

109,DATA,"   Yes, but... she needed my help.","""Inheritance"""
110,TROI,       That's how every parent feels.   It's very hard to let your   children go out into the world and   fend for themselves. You can't   help but be protective of them.   I'm sure your mother feels the   same way.,"""Inheritance"""
111,DATA,   If that is true... then why did   she never attempt to contact me?,"""Inheritance"""
112,TROI,"   I don't know, Data. It could have   something to do with your parents'   separating... you were part of a   life she might have wanted to put   behind her.","""Inheritance"""

114,DATA,"   We will be in position over the   drilling site in three minutes,   twenty-nine seconds.","""Inheritance"""
115,DATA,       These scans indicate that the   magma pockets where we plan to set   up the infusion units are somewhat   unstable.,"""Inheritance"""
116,JULIANA,   I'm going to monitor the density   of the rock layers and adjust the   strength of the particle beam as   we go. That should minimize the   seismic stress we generate while   we're drilling.,"""Inheritance"""
117,GEORDI,       I've configured the phasers to   create the most highly focused   particle beam possible.,"""Inheritance"""
118,DATA,"   Thank you, Geordi.","""Inheritance"""
119,JULIANA,       I'm just glad to see that you have   good manners. It wasn't easy to   strike the right balance in your   programming.,"""Inheritance"""
120,JULIANA,"       At first you couldn't have cared   less about social niceties like   ""please"" and ""thank you""; you   were... downright rude, in fact.","""Inheritance"""
121,GEORDI,   Data? That's hard to picture --,"""Inheritance"""
122,JULIANA,       But the first time we modified   your program we overcompensated;   it made you so obsequious your   Father couldn't stand to be in the   same room with you.,"""Inheritance"""
123,JULIANA,       That was nothing compared to the   problems we had --       Never mind. I don't want to   embarrass you.,"""Inheritance"""
124,DATA,"   I am incapable of embarrassment.   Please, continue.","""Inheritance"""
125,JULIANA,   One thing we didn't anticipate was   that you thought nothing of being   naked.       -- some of the colonists objected   to having an anatomically-correct   android running around without any   clothes on.,"""Inheritance"""
126,JULIANA,"       We asked you to dress, but you   felt it was unnecessary since you   didn't need protection from the   elements. We actually had to   write a modesty sub-routine to get   you to keep your clothes on.","""Inheritance"""
