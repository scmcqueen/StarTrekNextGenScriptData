119,GEORDI,"   We ran an analysis of the probe's   hull -- from the energy signatures   and particle deposits we found, it   looks like it travelled through a   Dichromic Nebula, was exposed to   an intensive gravimetric   distortion, and passed within a   light year of a class four pulsar.","""Bloodlines"""

137,BIRTA,"   You don't have to thank me,   Captain.","""Bloodlines"""
138,GEORDI,"   Believe it or not, sir -- that   might've given us the fix we   needed. There's a nebula in the   Dorias cluster that matches the   particle signature we found on the   probe.","""Bloodlines"""
139,DATA,       There is a class four pulsar three   light years from the nebula -- my   calculations indicate that the   probe was launched in the Xendi   Kabu system.,"""Bloodlines"""

144,PICARD,   I'm not sure I can tell you. He's   put up so many barriers... I don't   really know what's underneath.,"""Bloodlines"""
145,BEVERLY,   It would certainly be   understandable if he couldn't   accept you right away...,"""Bloodlines"""
146,PICARD,   I can't imagine that he'll ever   accept me. He won't even talk to   me.,"""Bloodlines"""
147,BEVERLY,   Keep in mind... he's had twenty   years to be angry that his father   wasn't there... it'll take time to   get over those feelings -- but I   think it's possible.,"""Bloodlines"""
148,PICARD,   Perhaps. But surely it would be   wrong of me to force the issue.,"""Bloodlines"""
149,PICARD,       He's made it clear he doesn't want   to pursue a relationship... I   believe I should respect his   feelings.,"""Bloodlines"""
150,BEVERLY,   Of course you want to take your   cues from him... move slowly...   but you might want to keep trying   to get through those barriers.,"""Bloodlines"""
151,PICARD,   What I sense about this young   man... is that he's very   independent.       I think it's best if I leave him   alone. Let him come to me if he   wants.,"""Bloodlines"""
152,BEVERLY,   Maybe you're right.       I just think you should consider   one thing.,"""Bloodlines"""
153,BEVERLY,       Are you really thinking about   what's best for Jason... or   easiest for you?,"""Bloodlines"""

160,TROI,   But you've never met your father   before.,"""Bloodlines"""
161,JASON,   I have to admit I never thought I   would.,"""Bloodlines"""
162,TROI,   It must be somewhat   overwhelming...,"""Bloodlines"""

179,PICARD,   Could it have been another   hologram?,"""Bloodlines"""
180,GEORDI,   I don't think so... something has   to generate a hologram -- we would   have detected it.,"""Bloodlines"""
181,PICARD,   Bok once used a mind control   device to make me hallucinate.,"""Bloodlines"""
