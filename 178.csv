389,JACK,"   Hello, Wesley. As I make this   recording, you're just ten weeks   old.       I want you to know who I am today.   You see, this Jack Crusher won't   exist by the time you're grown   up... I'll be older, more   experienced... hopefully a little   wiser. But this person will be   gone and I wanted you to know who   I am now, who your father was when   you came into this world.       I see you lying there in your   crib... and I realize that I don't   know the first thing about being   a father. So let me just   apologize for all the mistakes   I'm about to make as you grow up.    (disturbed by the     thought)   I hope you don't grow up...   resenting the fact that I was gone   so much. That comes with this   uniform. Right now, I'm waiting   for an assignment on the U.S.S.   Stargazer. I don't know if I can   explain why Starfleet is so   important to me... maybe you'll   understand when you get this...   later on.       Maybe you'll even want to try one   of these on.    (thinks, gives up,     laughs a little)   You'll probably be a doctor like   your mother.       We named you after Richard Wesley   Crusher, my grandfather, who gave   me my first flying lesson as a   boy. You come from a fine   family... of scholars, explorers,   artists... your great-great   grandfather was a painter whose   work once hung in the Prado...     ","""Family"""
