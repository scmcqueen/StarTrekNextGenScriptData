166,BEVERLY,   Meta-conscious?,"""Dark Page"""
167,TROI,   It's a part of the Betazoid   psyche. A kind of... filtering   mechanism to protect us from   psychic trauma.,"""Dark Page"""
168,PICARD,   Is Maques suggesting that   Lwaxana's meta-conscious is   damaged somehow?,"""Dark Page"""

170,BEVERLY,"   Did your Mother mention anything   that happened to her lately,   something that might have been   traumatic for her?","""Dark Page"""

250,HEDRIL,   Yes.,"""Dark Page"""
251,HEDRIL,       Is it my fault?,"""Dark Page"""
252,TROI,   No... not at all. But... I   believe my Mother has been   thinking about you. Do you know   why?,"""Dark Page"""
253,HEDRIL,   I make her sad.,"""Dark Page"""
254,TROI,   Why do you say that?,"""Dark Page"""
255,HEDRIL,   Because it's true.,"""Dark Page"""
256,TROI,       Do you have any idea why Hedril   would make my Mother sad?,"""Dark Page"""
257,MAQUES,   No.,"""Dark Page"""
258,TROI,"   Thank you for coming to talk to   us. I'll see you later, all   right?","""Dark Page"""
259,HEDRIL,   I hope your mother gets better.,"""Dark Page"""
260,TROI,"   Thank you, Hedril. So do I.","""Dark Page"""
261,TROI,   I just don't understand how she   fits in to all this...,"""Dark Page"""
262,BEVERLY,"   I still haven't been able to find   a physiological cause for what's   happened to your Mother. That   makes me think that Maques was   right, that her condition was   precipitated by some traumatic   event.","""Dark Page"""
263,PICARD,   Could this event have involved   Hedril?,"""Dark Page"""
264,TROI,   I don't think so. My Mother never   mentioned her.,"""Dark Page"""
265,BEVERLY,   Does your mother make personal   logs... or keep a journal?,"""Dark Page"""
266,TROI,"   Yes, she does. I'll contact   Mister Homn on Betazed and ask him   to transmit a copy as soon as   possible. Maybe there's a clue   there...","""Dark Page"""
267,DATA,"   Perhaps we are being too literal.   In my recent study of dream   analysis, I learned that people   who appear in a dream can   sometimes represent different   aspects of the person who is   dreaming.","""Dark Page"""
268,TROI,   That's right... a child might   represent vulnerability. Maybe   Hedril depicts some fragile part   of my mother.,"""Dark Page"""
269,PICARD,   A part that she's protecting...       ... you said everything you   encountered when you were in her   mind was a barrier of one kind or   another...,"""Dark Page"""
270,TROI,"   Yes... you, the wolf, my father...   as though she were summoning all   her defenses to keep me away.","""Dark Page"""
271,TROI,   But away from what? What is she   protecting?,"""Dark Page"""
272,TROI,   Come in.,"""Dark Page"""
273,PICARD,       Counselor...,"""Dark Page"""
274,TROI,"   Hello, Captain.","""Dark Page"""
275,PICARD,   I've just been in Sickbay. Doctor   Crusher feels your mother's   condition is deteriorating... her   neural functions are getting   weaker.,"""Dark Page"""
276,PICARD,   Have you had any luck here?,"""Dark Page"""
277,TROI,"   No, nothing. I've gone through   her belongings... and read her   journal from the last five   years...       ... and other than the fact that   I'm not married yet, nothing bad   seems to have happened to her.","""Dark Page"""
278,PICARD,   Is this your Father?,"""Dark Page"""
279,TROI,   Yes...,"""Dark Page"""
280,PICARD,   He had a kind face...,"""Dark Page"""
281,TROI,"       I remember when he died, my Mother   had to go through all his things   and pack them away... I was   seven... and I remember thinking   that he'd be mad when he came home   and saw what she'd done.       I didn't understand that he wasn't   coming back...","""Dark Page"""
282,PICARD,   Deanna... your Mother might still   come out of this.,"""Dark Page"""
283,TROI,   If we can't figure out what's   wrong with her -- I don't think   she will.,"""Dark Page"""
284,TROI,"   But I don't know what to do. I've   talked with Mister Homn, who's   known her for years. I've checked   her medical records. I've made   enquiries to the government on   Betazed and I've contacted several   of her close friends. If she   suffered some kind of psychic   trauma, there's just no evidence   of it.","""Dark Page"""
285,PICARD,   You said you'd reviewed her   journals for the past five years.   Perhaps we should go further back.,"""Dark Page"""
286,TROI,   There's a lot to review. My   mother's kept a journal since she   was first married...,"""Dark Page"""
287,PICARD,"   Well, let's start at the   beginning.","""Dark Page"""
288,PICARD,   The first entry seems to be   Stardate 30620.1.,"""Dark Page"""
289,TROI,   That's the year they were married.,"""Dark Page"""
290,PICARD,   This is odd... there's a seven   year gap.,"""Dark Page"""
291,TROI,   It starts about a year after my   parents were married...,"""Dark Page"""
292,PICARD,"   And if I'm not mistaken, it ends   a few months after your birth.","""Dark Page"""
293,TROI,   My Mother has always been so   diligent about her journal -- why   would she have stopped making   entries for so long?,"""Dark Page"""
294,PICARD,   She didn't. The files were   deleted.,"""Dark Page"""
295,PICARD,       By your Mother... almost thirty   years ago.,"""Dark Page"""
296,TROI,   I don't understand any of this...,"""Dark Page"""
297,TROI,"       Captain, I have to go back in to   my mother's mind. That's the only   way we're ever going to get any   answers.","""Dark Page"""
298,BEVERLY,"   Deanna... you understand that if   your para-cortical readings go too   high again, I'll have to tell   Maques to sever the connection.","""Dark Page"""
299,TROI,   I know.,"""Dark Page"""
300,TROI,"   Hedril, be careful...","""Dark Page"""
301,HEDRIL,   Who is Hedril?,"""Dark Page"""

307,TROI,   No... I want to help you.,"""Dark Page"""
308,TROI,       Why did you delete parts of your   journal?,"""Dark Page"""
309,TROI,       Did something happen to you --   something you don't want me to   know about?,"""Dark Page"""
310,LWAXANA,   Leave me alone... please...,"""Dark Page"""
311,TROI,"   Who is Hedril, Mother? Why is she   here?","""Dark Page"""
312,TROI,       Is Hedril me -- when I was a   little girl?,"""Dark Page"""
313,LWAXANA,   No -- I would never let anything   happen to you... never.,"""Dark Page"""
314,TROI,   Did you let something happen to   someone... ?,"""Dark Page"""

348,LWAXANA,   How can I? I let her die...,"""Dark Page"""
349,TROI,   It was a terrible tragedy -- the   worst thing that can happen to any   parent... I know you feel   responsible... but it was an   accident...,"""Dark Page"""
