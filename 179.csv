144,GEORDI,   There was a momentary flash of   light. It was all over the   spectrum.,"""Remember Me"""
145,BEVERLY,   I remember that.,"""Remember Me"""
146,PICARD,   Are you suggesting this bubble   could have made Doctor Quaice   disappear?,"""Remember Me"""

171,BEVERLY,   I know how it must sound...,"""Remember Me"""
172,PICARD,   None of the scans reveal any   anomalies... there is no sign of   an intruder... Wesley's experiment   clearly did not have the scope   to affect an entire starship...,"""Remember Me"""
173,BEVERLY,   The Enterprise is in serious   danger. You must believe me...,"""Remember Me"""
