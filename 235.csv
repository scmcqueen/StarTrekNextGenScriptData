0,WORF,   Commander... is it your intention   to continue growing your beard?,"The Quality of Life"""
1,GEORDI,"   I'm not sure, Worf. Why?","The Quality of Life"""
2,WORF,   I am just asking.,"The Quality of Life"""
3,BEVERLY,"   Seven-card stud, one-eyed jacks   are wild. Frankly, I like your   beard, Geordi.","The Quality of Life"""
4,GEORDI,"   Thanks, Doctor.","The Quality of Life"""
5,BEVERLY,"   The king is high... your bet, Wil.","The Quality of Life"""
6,BEVERLY,"   Of course, I'm always a little   suspicious of men with beards.","The Quality of Life"""
7,WORF,   For what reason?,"The Quality of Life"""
8,BEVERLY,   I don't know... it's as though   they're trying to hide something.,"The Quality of Life"""
9,RIKER,"   Hide -- ? Doctor, that's   ridiculous. Beards are a proud   and ancient tradition.","The Quality of Life"""
10,GEORDI,   Some of the most esteemed men in   history had beards.,"The Quality of Life"""
11,BEVERLY,   I know... but after the razor was   invented... I think beards became   mostly a fashion statement.,"The Quality of Life"""
12,WORF,"   I am not concerned with fashion.   To a Klingon, a beard is a symbol   of courage.","The Quality of Life"""
13,RIKER,   I think it suggests a certain...   strength.,"The Quality of Life"""
14,BEVERLY,"   Sure. After all, women can't grow   one.","The Quality of Life"""
15,GEORDI,"   Doctor, I get the feeling you   think beards are nothing more than   an affectation.","The Quality of Life"""
16,BEVERLY,   I do. I'm not saying there's   anything wrong with that... women   wear makeup and nail polish for   the same reason.       I just think you men should admit   it.,"The Quality of Life"""
17,RIKER,   My beard isn't an affectation.,"The Quality of Life"""
18,BEVERLY,   Oh? Then why not shave it off?,"The Quality of Life"""
19,RIKER,   I could lose it in a minute.       I've just gotten used to it.,"The Quality of Life"""
20,BEVERLY,   Okay... what do you say we up the   stakes a little? If I win this   hand... you all shave off your   beards.,"The Quality of Life"""
21,GEORDI,   What if one of us wins? What do   you give up?,"The Quality of Life"""
22,BEVERLY,       I'm open to suggestions...,"The Quality of Life"""
23,RIKER,   I've always wondered what you'd   look like as a brunette...,"The Quality of Life"""
24,BEVERLY,   I tried it once when I was   thirteen. I couldn't wait to   change it back.,"The Quality of Life"""
25,RIKER,   That makes me even more curious...,"The Quality of Life"""
26,BEVERLY,   Fine. If one of you wins -- I   become a brunette. Are we on?,"The Quality of Life"""
27,GEORDI,   We'll take that bet.,"The Quality of Life"""
28,RIKER,       Geordi...,"The Quality of Life"""
29,BEVERLY,"   Sounds like you have the hand to   beat, Commander.    ","The Quality of Life"""
30,BEVERLY ,       I'm in for two hundred.,"The Quality of Life"""
31,GEORDI,   I'll see that and raise two   hundred.,"The Quality of Life"""

35,RIKER,"   Sorry, Doctor, you heard the   Captain. Duty calls.","The Quality of Life"""
36,RIKER,   I'm sure we can try this another   time.,"The Quality of Life"""
37,PICARD ,"   Captain's Log, stardate 46307.2.   We have just come into orbit of   Tyrus-Seven-A to monitor progress   on the Tyran particle fountain,   a radically new mining technology.","The Quality of Life"""
38,PICARD ,"   So far the project has been   fraught with problems, and is well   behind schedule. Mister La Forge   has been assigned to evaluate the   situation.","The Quality of Life"""
39,GEORDI,       Doctor Farallon. The original   design called for the particle   fountain to lift five-hundred   kilograms per minute from the   surface -- so far it hasn't come   close to that.,"The Quality of Life"""
40,FARALLON,   That's why I want to increase the   stream density -- that should   boost the lift capacity by   seventy-two percent.,"The Quality of Life"""
41,GEORDI,   Yeah... and overload the field   generators in the process.,"The Quality of Life"""
42,FARALLON,       Not if we distribute the overload   evenly throughout the system.,"The Quality of Life"""
43,GEORDI,   Doctor... forgive me... but maybe   we should concentrate on getting   this phase of the project   completed... before we start   talking about re-designing it...,"The Quality of Life"""
44,FARALLON,   Commander... I know you're here   to evaluate this project...,"The Quality of Life"""
45,GEORDI,       Starfleet is considering whether   to use a particle fountain on   Carema Three... they want to know   how feasible it is.,"The Quality of Life"""
46,FARALLON,   And will your opinion be the   deciding factor?,"The Quality of Life"""
47,GEORDI,   Not really... I'll make my report   to Captain Picard... he'll make   the official recommendation to   Starfleet... and they'll decide.,"The Quality of Life"""
48,FARALLON,   Well. What's your feeling so far?,"The Quality of Life"""
49,GEORDI,   I guess the question we have to   ask... is if this technology is   any more efficient than   conventional mining techniques.,"The Quality of Life"""
50,FARALLON,   Commander... I know we've had   problems here. It seems like   nothing's gone right... it's   taking a lot longer than I thought   to get the particle stream to full   strength.       But I know it can work. This   is the direction mining will take   in the future... and it should   be implemented on Carema Three.,"The Quality of Life"""
51,GEORDI,   I agree that potentially it's very   exciting...,"The Quality of Life"""
52,FARALLON,   I want to show you something I've   been working on... something that   might help us complete this   project more quickly.,"The Quality of Life"""
53,FARALLON,   I've used these on a limited   basis... I think they've earned   a try...,"The Quality of Life"""
54,DATA,   Enterprise to Commander La Forge.   I am reading significant power   fluctuations from the station   core. Please report.,"The Quality of Life"""

57,DATA,   Do you require assistance?,"The Quality of Life"""
58,GEORDI,   Stand by.,"The Quality of Life"""
59,GEORDI,   I think we're going to have to   shut it down.,"The Quality of Life"""
60,FARALLON,"   It took four months to get the   particle flux up to this level.   If we shut down, it'll take   another four months just to get   it back.","The Quality of Life"""
61,GEORDI,"   We have less than five minutes   before we lose confinement. When   that happens, the particle stream   will flood the entire station,   and then we'll have to shut it   down anyway.","The Quality of Life"""
62,FARALLON,   Then we'll just have to fix the   power grid.,"The Quality of Life"""
63,GEORDI,   How do we do that?       The defective grid is two hundred   meters down conduit A-Four. We'd   have to disassemble four   bulkheads to get to it...,"The Quality of Life"""
64,FARALLON,   Well... here's the perfect   opportunity to show you what I   had in mind...,"The Quality of Life"""
65,GEORDI,   What is it?,"The Quality of Life"""

76,DATA,   Energize.,"The Quality of Life"""
77,KELSO,"   Aye, sir.","The Quality of Life"""
78,DATA,"   Welcome to the Enterprise, Doctor.   I am Lieutenant Commander Data.","The Quality of Life"""
79,FARALLON,   Mister Data. I was hoping I'd   have a chance to meet you. I've   done extensive studies of your   positronic network.,"The Quality of Life"""
80,DATA,"   And I have studied your design   for the particle fountain, Doctor.   I find the concept to be highly   innovative.","The Quality of Life"""
81,FARALLON,   Thank you.,"The Quality of Life"""
82,DATA,   I am curious how you were able   to repair the power grid so   quickly.,"The Quality of Life"""
83,FARALLON,"   This should make it clear,   Commander.","The Quality of Life"""
84,GEORDI,   We can set up in Engineering.,"The Quality of Life"""
85,FARALLON,   Is it true that your computational   speed is limited only by the   physical separation of your   positronic links?,"The Quality of Life"""
86,DATA,"   Actually, that is no longer the   case.     ","The Quality of Life"""
87,,,"The Quality of Life"""
88,DATA ,"   I recently converted my main   interlink sequencer to   asynchronous operation, which   removed that performance   constraint.","The Quality of Life"""

90,FARALLON,   I see. But how did you resolve   the signal fragmentation?,"The Quality of Life"""
91,DATA,   The interlink sequencer is now   bi-directional. It compensates   for...,"The Quality of Life"""
92,FARALLON,   We've been using devices like this   on Tyrus Seven for years... the   basic unit is a common industrial   servo-mechanism.       A few years ago... I started   tinkering with one... this is the   result.,"The Quality of Life"""
93,GEORDI,"       Boridium power converter...   axionic chip network... very   sophisticated.       In terms of sheer computational   speed, this little guy could   almost compete with you, Data.","The Quality of Life"""
94,FARALLON,"   Oh, the exocomps don't come close   to Data's sophistication...","The Quality of Life"""
95,DATA,"   ""Exocomps... ?""","The Quality of Life"""
96,FARALLON,   That's what I call them.,"The Quality of Life"""
97,FARALLON,   Let's say you had an anti-matter   flow converter that was   fluctuating. How would you repair   it?,"The Quality of Life"""
98,DATA,   The correct procedure would be   to adjust the converter.,"The Quality of Life"""
99,FARALLON,   With what?,"The Quality of Life"""
100,DATA,   A mode stabilizer.,"The Quality of Life"""
101,FARALLON,"   Okay, let me input the problem   into the exocomp.       ... a fluctuating anti-matter flow   converter...       Now let's see what happens.","The Quality of Life"""
102,GEORDI,   A mode stabilizer. Very nice.,"The Quality of Life"""
103,DATA,   You have incorporated a   micro-replication system into the   device... in order to fashion   tools.,"The Quality of Life"""
104,FARALLON,"   It's more than that. I designed   the exocomps to be problem   solvers. Whenever they perform   a task they've never done before,   the micro-replicator creates new   circuit pathways within the unit's   memory.","The Quality of Life"""
105,DATA,"   So... in a sense, they are   ""learning.""","The Quality of Life"""
106,FARALLON,"   Exactly. The more situations they   encounter, the more circuit   pathways they build. They become   better tools as they work.","The Quality of Life"""
107,GEORDI,"   Well, it's impressive technology,   no doubt about it. Once it's out   of the experimental stage there'll   be plenty of applications --","The Quality of Life"""
108,FARALLON,"   Commander, I'm hoping the   experimental stage is over.","The Quality of Life"""
109,FARALLON,       When are we supposed to brief   Captain Picard on the status of   the particle fountain?,"The Quality of Life"""
110,GEORDI,   At sixteen hundred hours.,"The Quality of Life"""
111,FARALLON,   Good. I have something to ask   him.,"The Quality of Life"""
112,FARALLON,"   Captain, I know you're supposed   to give your evaluation to   Starfleet today. I'd like you   to postpone that report another   forty-eight hours.","The Quality of Life"""
113,PICARD,"   The Enterprise is scheduled to   leave the Tyran System tomorrow.   If I'm to change that plan, I'll   need a good reason.","The Quality of Life"""
114,FARALLON,"   I realize that, sir.","The Quality of Life"""
115,FARALLON,   If you're going to make a   recommendation to Starfleet about   using the particle fountain on   Carema... it seems only fair that   you see it working at full   strength.,"The Quality of Life"""
116,PICARD,   Agreed.,"The Quality of Life"""
117,FARALLON,   I think I can complete the   project... and boost the   efficiency of the particle   stream... if I use exocomps --   the new devices I've constructed.,"The Quality of Life"""
118,PICARD,   I understand one of these devices   successfully repaired the faulty   power grid...,"The Quality of Life"""
119,FARALLON,"   Yes, sir. I've been testing them   on a limited basis, but I think   they're ready to be used on a   larger scale.","The Quality of Life"""
120,PICARD,"   Mister La Forge, what are your   thoughts?","The Quality of Life"""
121,GEORDI,   I guess the only risk... is   falling even further behind.,"The Quality of Life"""
122,FARALLON,   I'm willing to take that risk.,"The Quality of Life"""
123,PICARD,   Mister Data?,"The Quality of Life"""
124,DATA,"   The exocomps are highly   sophisticated devices, sir. If   they perform to expectations,   their potential to advance this   project is considerable.","The Quality of Life"""
125,PICARD,"   I'm inclined to agree. I don't   think forty-eight hours is too   much time to risk -- particularly   when the gains might be   substantial.       You may proceed, Doctor.","The Quality of Life"""
126,FARALLON,"   Thank you, sir.       If possible, I'd like Commander   Data to work with me.","The Quality of Life"""
127,DATA,"   Thank you, Doctor. I would   welcome the opportunity.","The Quality of Life"""
128,FARALLON,   Commander. There's a plasma   conduit in one of the access   tunnels that's ready to be   sealed. It's the perfect job for   an exocomp.,"The Quality of Life"""
129,DATA,"   I agree, Doctor.","The Quality of Life"""
130,FARALLON,"   Well, Mister Data. What is your   analysis so far?","The Quality of Life"""
131,DATA,   I have successfully completed   fourteen separate tasks with this   exocomp in the past hour. I   estimate it would have taken two   people nine hours to accomplish   the same tasks. I would   characterize the unit's   performance as excellent.,"The Quality of Life"""
132,FARALLON,       I hope Commander La Forge and   Captain Picard agree with you.,"The Quality of Life"""
133,DATA,   I am confident that they will.   Commander La Forge is an excellent   --,"The Quality of Life"""
134,FARALLON,       It didn't finish sealing the   plasma conduit.       Send it back in.,"The Quality of Life"""
135,DATA,   It is not accepting my commands.,"The Quality of Life"""
136,FARALLON,   Maybe there's a malfunction in   its control processor. Let me   see if I can override it...,"The Quality of Life"""
137,DATA,   Doctor --,"The Quality of Life"""
138,FARALLON,       I'm all right. The control padd   just overloaded.       What's the matter with this thing?,"The Quality of Life"""
139,FARALLON,   The exocomp came out of the   plasma conduit... we tried to   override the commands and send   it back in... but it just -- shut   down. It's been completely   unresponsive ever since.,"The Quality of Life"""
140,GEORDI,   Let's see what our computer has   to say...,"The Quality of Life"""
141,DATA,   The interface circuitry which   links the exocomp to the control   padd has been completely burned   out.,"The Quality of Life"""
142,GEORDI,   That's strange... is there any   evidence of secondary power   surges?,"The Quality of Life"""
143,DATA,   No.,"The Quality of Life"""
144,GEORDI,"   But what's going on there... ?   Data, increase magnification in   section Gamma-Four.","The Quality of Life"""
145,DATA,   Interesting... the number of   circuit pathways within the   exocomp has increased by   six-hundred thirty-two percent.,"The Quality of Life"""
146,FARALLON,"   Oh, no...","The Quality of Life"""
147,GEORDI,   What is it?,"The Quality of Life"""
148,FARALLON,"   Sometimes an exocomp starts   forming large numbers of new   pathways -- totally at random.   Eventually, it reaches a point   where it shuts down. Just like   this one.","The Quality of Life"""
149,DATA,   Doctor... the new pathways do not   appear to be interfering with the   original circuitry --,"The Quality of Life"""
150,FARALLON,"       Once an exocomp is this badly   corrupted, it's useless. You have   to erase the unit and start all   over again. And there's no time   for that now.","The Quality of Life"""
151,GEORDI,   That leaves you with only two of   them... it's going to slow you   down...,"The Quality of Life"""
152,FARALLON,"       Yes, Commander. You have the   right to point out that you told   me so...","The Quality of Life"""
153,GEORDI,   I just wanted to say that we'll   be happy to add an extra shift   to take up the slack...,"The Quality of Life"""
154,FARALLON,   I'm sorry. I guess I'm touchy   these days.,"The Quality of Life"""
155,GEORDI,   It's okay... you've got a lot on   your shoulders.,"The Quality of Life"""
156,FARALLON,"   Guess I'd better get back to it...       Thanks, Commander.","The Quality of Life"""
157,GEORDI,   I feel sorry for her. This   project has had nothing but   problems.       Why did that plasma conduit   explode?,"The Quality of Life"""
158,DATA,   Apparently there was a   micro-fracture in the conduit   wall. The fault did not register   on our instruments.,"The Quality of Life"""
159,GEORDI,       I guess it's a good thing the   exocomp malfunctioned... almost   seems like it knew just when to   leave.,"The Quality of Life"""
160,DATA,"   Geordi, are you implying that the   exocomp was exhibiting a form   of self-preservation?","The Quality of Life"""
161,GEORDI,       Of course not.,"The Quality of Life"""
162,TECHNICIAN,"   Lieutenant Pierson to Commander   La Forge... sir, could you join   us in the systems monitor room?","The Quality of Life"""

171,DATA,   How... and when... was it   repaired?,"The Quality of Life"""
172,COMPUTER,   The exocomp activated a   self-repair program at thirteen   hundred forty hours.,"The Quality of Life"""

174,COMPUTER,   Unknown.,"The Quality of Life"""
175,GEORDI,   There you are... I thought you'd   be hard at work by now.,"The Quality of Life"""
176,FARALLON,"   I wanted a quiet cup of tea before   I went back... gathering strength,   I guess...","The Quality of Life"""
177,GEORDI,   I came to tell you I've assigned   two engineering teams to work on   the particle fountain.,"The Quality of Life"""
178,FARALLON,"   Thank you, Commander. I'm   grateful.","The Quality of Life"""
179,GEORDI,   I really admire the work you've   done. And I'm sorry if the   exocomps aren't working out...,"The Quality of Life"""

185,GEORDI,"       Well, if it comes down to sheer   determination -- you'll get that   particle fountain built.","The Quality of Life"""
186,FARALLON,"   You're right about that,   Commander. I've spent the last   six years of my life on this   project. It's the first thought   I have when I wake up and the last   before I go to bed. Whatever   it takes to prove this   technology... I'll do it.","The Quality of Life"""

196,DATA,   I am searching for a definition   which will allow me to test an   hypothesis.,"The Quality of Life"""

225,PICARD,"   Doctor, I appreciate the time   constraints you're under. But   recognizing new life -- whatever   its form -- is the principal   mission of this vessel.       Mister Data, what makes you think   the exocomps could be alive?","The Quality of Life"""
226,DATA,"   Sir, when the exocomp left the   access tunnel prior to the   explosion, I believe it may have   been attempting to save itself   from destruction.","The Quality of Life"""
227,FARALLON,   Do you have any basis for that   conclusion?,"The Quality of Life"""

232,DATA,"   However, two hours later, when   the exocomp was aboard the   Enterprise and no longer in   danger... it repaired itself.","The Quality of Life"""
233,DATA,"   I believe that the exocomp was   protecting itself. And if that   is true, it has demonstrated an   awareness of its environment --   and an ability to adapt to that   environment.","The Quality of Life"""
234,FARALLON,"   You're anthropomorphizing these   units. Like any mechanical   device, they occasionally   malfunction. One time, I saw an   exocomp enter a reaction chamber   for no apparent reason and   vaporize itself. Is that supposed   to make me think it was suicidal?","The Quality of Life"""
235,TROI,"       Doctor, why is it so difficult   for you to accept the fact that   the exocomp could be alive?       After all, you're talking to a   living machine right now.","The Quality of Life"""

253,DATA,"   We have created a small conduit   breach in this tube. The exocomp   would normally require several   minutes to complete this type of   repair. However, once it enters   the tube, it will find that a   plasma cascade failure is in   progress.","The Quality of Life"""

419,DATA,"   Thank you, Doctor.       I wish your work on the particle   fountain had been more   successful... perhaps the exocomps   will be able to help you to   re-construct it.","The Quality of Life"""
420,FARALLON,   I hope they will...       ... and I predict in a year or two   you'll be able to recommend the   technology to Starfleet.,"The Quality of Life"""
421,PICARD,   I'll look forward to it.,"The Quality of Life"""
422,PICARD,"   Something more, Mister Data?","The Quality of Life"""
423,DATA,"   Yes, sir. I thought you might   be curious why I would be willing   to risk your life for several small   machines.","The Quality of Life"""
424,PICARD,   I think I understand the   predicament you were in. It   cannot have been an easy choice.,"The Quality of Life"""
425,DATA,"   No, sir. It was not. Several   years ago, when my status as a   living being was in question,   you fought to protect my rights   -- and for that, I will always   be grateful.       The exocomps had no such advocate,   sir. If I had not acted in their   behalf, they would have been   destroyed. I could not allow that   to happen.","The Quality of Life"""
