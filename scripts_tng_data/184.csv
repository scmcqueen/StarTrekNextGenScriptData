373,GEORDI,   Data's right. The principle is   the same. A cosmic string   emanates a characteristic set of   subspace frequencies as atomic   particles decay along its event   horizon. I could use the ship's   parabolic dish to amplify and   reflect those frequencies back   toward the cluster. The   Enterprise itself would echo the   cosmic string.,72A  INT.
