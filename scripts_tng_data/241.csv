346,PICARD,   Q... ?,34A  INT. TEN FORWARD,TEN FORWARD,INT.,Tapestry,AHHH,The Next Generation,241.txt
347,GEORDI,   La Forge to Lieutenant Picard.   I'm still waiting for your final   sensor usage log.,34A  INT. TEN FORWARD,TEN FORWARD,INT.,Tapestry,AHHH,The Next Generation,241.txt
348,PICARD,"       I'm on my way, sir.",34A  INT. TEN FORWARD,TEN FORWARD,INT.,Tapestry,AHHH,The Next Generation,241.txt
349,PICARD,       Main Engineering.,34B  INT. CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,INT.,Tapestry,AHHH,The Next Generation,241.txt
350,PICARD,"   Are you having a good laugh now,   Q? Does it amuse you to think of   me living out the rest of my life   as a dreary man in a tedious job?",34B  INT. CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,INT.,Tapestry,AHHH,The Next Generation,241.txt
351,Q,   I gave you something most mortals   never experience... a second   chance at life. And now all you   can do is complain?,34B  INT. CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,INT.,Tapestry,AHHH,The Next Generation,241.txt
352,PICARD,   I can't live out my days as that   person. That man is bereft of   passion and imagination. That's   not who I am.,34B  INT. CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,INT.,Tapestry,AHHH,The Next Generation,241.txt
353,Q,"   Au contraire. He's the person you   wanted to be... one who was less   arrogant, and undisciplined as a   youth.       One who was less like me.",34B  INT. CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,INT.,Tapestry,AHHH,The Next Generation,241.txt
354,Q,"   The Jean-Luc Picard you wanted to   be, the one who did not fight the   Nausicaan, had quite a different   career from the one you remember.     ",34B  INT. CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,INT.,Tapestry,AHHH,The Next Generation,241.txt
355,Q ,"   That Picard never had a brush with   death... never came face to face   with his own mortality... never   realized how fragile life is...   how important each moment can   be... so his life never came into   focus. He drifted through much of   his career, with no plan or   agenda... going from one   assignment to the next, never   seizing the opportunities that   presented themselves...       He didn't lead the Away Team on   Milika Three to save that   ambassador... he didn't take   charge of the Stargazer's Bridge   when its Captain was killed...   and no one ever offered him a   command.       He learned to play it safe. And   he never, ever got noticed by   anyone.",34B  INT. CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,INT.,Tapestry,AHHH,The Next Generation,241.txt
356,PICARD,   You're right. You gave me the   chance to change and I took that   opportunity. But I freely admit   now that it was a mistake.,34B  INT. CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,INT.,Tapestry,AHHH,The Next Generation,241.txt
357,Q,"   Are you asking me for something,   Jean-Luc?",34B  INT. CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,INT.,Tapestry,AHHH,The Next Generation,241.txt
358,PICARD,   Yes.       Give me a chance to put things   back to the way they were before.,34B  INT. CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,INT.,Tapestry,AHHH,The Next Generation,241.txt
359,Q,"   Before, you died in Sickbay. Is   that what you want?",34B  INT. CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,INT.,Tapestry,AHHH,The Next Generation,241.txt
360,PICARD,   I would rather die as the man I   was... than live the life I just   saw.,34B  INT. CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,INT.,Tapestry,AHHH,The Next Generation,241.txt
361,PICARD,   Please.,34B  INT. CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT,INT.,Tapestry,AHHH,The Next Generation,241.txt

368,PICARD,   ... I still don't know what to make   of it all. Was it a dream? Or   one of Q's elaborate tricks?,42   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE,OBSERVATION LOUNGE,INT.,Tapestry,AHHH,The Next Generation,241.txt
369,RIKER,   A lot of people who've been near   death have talked about strange   experiences... but they're not   usually so detailed.,42   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE,OBSERVATION LOUNGE,INT.,Tapestry,AHHH,The Next Generation,241.txt
370,PICARD,   Part of me cannot accept the idea   that Q would have given me a   second chance... that he would   demonstrate that much...   compassion.       But if it was Q... I owe him a   debt of gratitude.,42   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE,OBSERVATION LOUNGE,INT.,Tapestry,AHHH,The Next Generation,241.txt
371,RIKER,   In what sense? It sounds like he   put you through hell.,42   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE,OBSERVATION LOUNGE,INT.,Tapestry,AHHH,The Next Generation,241.txt
372,PICARD,   There were many things in my youth   that I'm not proud of... they were   loose threads... untidy parts of   myself that I wanted to remove.       But when I pulled on one of those   threads... I unravelled the   tapestry of my life.,42   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE,OBSERVATION LOUNGE,INT.,Tapestry,AHHH,The Next Generation,241.txt
373,RIKER,       I was just trying to imagine you   as a hell-bent-for-leather young   officer insulting a Nausicaan   twice your size. I wish I'd   gotten a chance to meet that Jean-Luc   Picard.,42   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE,OBSERVATION LOUNGE,INT.,Tapestry,AHHH,The Next Generation,241.txt
