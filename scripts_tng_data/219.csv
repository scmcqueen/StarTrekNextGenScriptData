318,BRAND,"   Captain Satelk and I have gone   over your testimony and the   physical evidence from the crash.       Your statements cannot be   reconciled with the data collected   from the NavCon satellite.   Your unwillingness to offer any   explanation for this contradiction   is disappointing, and it raises   suspicion. We cannot escape the   conclusion that either the data   is faulty in some way... or you   have lied to us.       However... suspicion is not   proof... and I have no proof that   you have lied to this inquiry.     ",63   INT. HEARING ROOM,HEARING ROOM,INT.,The First Duty,1992-01-22,The Next Generation,219.txt

For filing an inaccurate flight   plan, and for allowing Cadet   Albert to fly despite the fact   that you knew he had been having   difficulties, I am ordering a   formal reprimand placed on each   of your permanent records. I am   also revoking your flight   privileges.       This inquiry is closed.",63   INT. HEARING ROOM,HEARING ROOM,INT.,The First Duty,1992-01-22,The Next Generation,219.txt
