Not you -- you take shortcuts...   right through living tissue. You   put your ""research"" ahead of your   patients, and as far as I'm   concerned, that's a violation of   our most sacred trust.       No one remembers the patients who   died unnecessarily... not in the   glow of a remarkable achievement   like this one, do they?
