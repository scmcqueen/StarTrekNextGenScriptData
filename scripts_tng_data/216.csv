351,BEVERLY,"   I'm delighted that Worf is going   to recover. You gambled. He won.   Most of your patients aren't so   lucky.       You scare me, Doctor. You risk   peoples' lives and justify it in   the name of research. But genuine   research takes time... sometimes   a lifetime of painstaking,   detailed work to get results.   Not you -- you take shortcuts...   right through living tissue. You   put your ""research"" ahead of your   patients, and as far as I'm   concerned, that's a violation of   our most sacred trust.       No one remembers the patients who   died unnecessarily... not in the   glow of a remarkable achievement   like this one, do they? I'm sure   the work you've done here will be   hailed as a stunning breakthrough.   Enjoy your laurels, Doctor. I'm not   sure I could.",58   INT.
