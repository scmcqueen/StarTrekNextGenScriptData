43,NECHEYEV,   Yes. The Federation has just   completed a very long and   difficult series of negotiations   regarding the final status of our   border with the Cardassians.,3    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE,OBSERVATION LOUNGE,INT.,Journey's End,1994-01-20,The Next Generation,272.txt
44,NECHEYEV,"       These will be the official   boundaries... you'll notice that   a demilitarized zone has also been   created along the border.

46,NECHEYEV,"   The agreement is by no means   perfect... neither side got   everything they wanted... but   everyone got something. And as   someone once said, diplomacy is   the art of the possible.       Those colonies finding themselves   on the wrong side of the border   will have to be moved.",3    INT.

48,NECHEYEV,   It won't be easy... but it is a   reasonable price to pay for peace.       Your mission is to evacuate the   colony on Dorvan Five.,3    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE,OBSERVATION LOUNGE,INT.,Journey's End,1994-01-20,The Next Generation,272.txt

52,PICARD,"       Admiral... centuries ago, the   North American Indians were   forcibly displaced from their   ancestral lands.

56,NECHEYEV,"       Captain, the Indians colonized   Dorvan only twenty years ago...   and at that time they were warned   the planet was hotly disputed by   the Cardassians. The bottom line   is... they never should have   settled there in the first place.",3    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE,OBSERVATION LOUNGE,INT.,Journey's End,1994-01-20,The Next Generation,272.txt
57,PICARD,   Then perhaps we should not have   allowed them to settle the planet   originally. But to go to them   twenty years later and ask them to   leave what is now their home...,3    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE,OBSERVATION LOUNGE,INT.,Journey's End,1994-01-20,The Next Generation,272.txt
58,NECHEYEV,   I made the same argument to the   Federation Council. But it took   three years to negotiate this   treaty... some concessions had to   be made... and this is one of   them.,3    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE,OBSERVATION LOUNGE,INT.,Journey's End,1994-01-20,The Next Generation,272.txt
59,PICARD,   What if the Indians should...   refuse to evacuate?,3    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE,OBSERVATION LOUNGE,INT.,Journey's End,1994-01-20,The Next Generation,272.txt
60,NECHEYEV,       Then your orders are to remove   them... by any means necessary.,3    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE,OBSERVATION LOUNGE,INT.,Journey's End,1994-01-20,The Next Generation,272.txt

My people have always had an...   intimate bond with nature. We   think of ourselves as being a part   of it... and it being a part of   us. One of the reasons our   ancestors left Earth two hundred   years ago was because that bond   had been severed.",9    INT.

103,ANTHWARA,"   We believe -- very strongly --   that nature should not be ""fixed""   or controlled. Droughts and   floods... tornadoes and   hurricanes... these are natural   events.

108,ANTHWARA,   Then you should respect the fact   that this planet holds a deeply   spiritual significance for us. It   took us two centuries to find a   place where the mountains gave us   permission to use their stone for   our houses... where the rivers let   us drink from their waters... and   where the wind sang to us at   night.

119,PICARD,   ... so I've been trying to   familiarize myself with the   history and traditions of your   people.

121,PICARD,   It must have been a very difficult   decision for your grandfather to   make... uprooting your people...   leading them into the unknown for   an undetermined amount of time...   not even knowing if you ever would   find a new home.,14   INT. TEN FORWARD,TEN FORWARD,INT.,Journey's End,1994-01-20,The Next Generation,272.txt
122,ANTHWARA,   There was great deal of   opposition. Even my own father   was against it... but when Katowa   made his decision -- that was it.   My father never said another word.,14   INT. TEN FORWARD,TEN FORWARD,INT.,Journey's End,1994-01-20,The Next Generation,272.txt
123,PICARD,       It's never easy to leave one's   home... to give up the safe and   familiar. But there are times   when the greater good demands that   sacrifices be made... I'm sure   your grandfather knew that.,14   INT. TEN FORWARD,TEN FORWARD,INT.,Journey's End,1994-01-20,The Next Generation,272.txt
124,ANTHWARA,       His grandson does too. But there   are also times when a people have   sacrificed too much... when they   must hold on to what they have...   even if it means standing up   against overwhelming opposition.,14   INT.

127,ANTHWARA,"   Tell me about your family. We   have very strong ties to our   ancestors... we believe their   actions guide us even now.
