332,DATA,"   Sir, I wish to submit myself for   disciplinary action       I disobeyed a direct order from   a superior officer. Although   there was a positive outcome as   a result of my actions, I have   learned that... the ends cannot   justify the means.",76   INT.

333,PICARD,"   No, they can't.       However... the excuse ""I was only   following orders"" is the epitaph   of too many tragedies in our   history. Starfleet does not want   officers who will blindly follow   orders without analyzing the   situation.       Your actions were appropriate for   the circumstance, and I have noted   that in your record.",76   INT. ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM,ENTERPRISE,INT.,"""Redemption II""",1991-07-01,The Next Generation
