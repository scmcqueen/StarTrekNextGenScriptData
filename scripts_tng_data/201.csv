17,PICARD,   There have been three major   engagements in the last two   weeks... all of them won by ships   loyal to the Duras family.,12B  INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE,OBSERVATION LOUNGE,INT.,Redemption II,1991-07-01,The Next Generation,201.txt
18,SHANTHI,"   None of which is our concern,   Jean-Luc. The Klingon civil war   is, by definition, an internal   matter of the Empire.",12B  INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE,OBSERVATION LOUNGE,INT.,Redemption II,1991-07-01,The Next Generation,201.txt
19,PICARD,"   Agreed. But if the Duras are   being aided by the Romulans, then   it becomes very much our concern.",12B  INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE,OBSERVATION LOUNGE,INT.,Redemption II,1991-07-01,The Next Generation,201.txt
20,PICARD,"       The Romulans have been trying to   destroy the Federation/Klingon   Alliance for over twenty years,   and at the same time, the Duras   have been secretly conspiring with   the Romulans.       Doesn't it strike you as odd that   the Duras are able to field such   an overpowering force against   Gowron? That they outmatch him   at almost every turn?",12B  INT.

22,PICARD,"   And some would say they must be   getting help.       The Romulans have always been   willing to take enormous risks   in order to gain any advantage   over the Federation.       Can we seriously believe that now,   with the future of the entire   Klingon Empire hanging in the   balance, they are content to   simply stand by and watch?",12B  INT.

24,PICARD,"   We must stop the flow of supplies   and equipment from the Romulans   to the Duras family.       I propose we take a fleet of ships   to the Romulan/Klingon border.   We'll take no offensive action,   but we'll be in a position to   expose any Romulan shipments that   try to cross the border.",12B  INT.

26,PICARD,"   My chief engineer has developed   a system that should help us   nullify that advantage. Each ship   will send out an active tachyon   beam to the other ships in the   blockade fleet. In theory, any   cloaked vessel that tries to pass   between our ships should cross   one of those beams and be   detected.",12B  INT.
