I wanted to give   something back in return for all   Starfleet has given me. I still   do. But Lal is my child. You   ask that I volunteer to give her   up. I cannot. That would   violate every lesson I have   learned about human parenting.       As Captain Picard told me after   he first met her, I have taken   on ""quite a responsibility."" I   have brought a new life into this   world. It is my duty, not   Starfleet's, to guide her through   these first difficult steps to   maturity, to support her as she   learns, to prepare her to be a   contributing member of society.
