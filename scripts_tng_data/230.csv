18,PICARD,"   It's a very old theory, Number   One. I'm not surprised you   haven't heard of it. A twentieth   century physicist, Freeman Dyson,   postulated that an enormous hollow   sphere could be constructed around   a star.

324,GEORDI,   Did you try hailing them?,47   INT. JENOLEN (OPTICAL),JENOLEN,INT.,Relics,1992-08-04,The Next Generation,230.txt
325,SCOTT,   Sure. That was standard   procedure in my day. We did it   right before we crashed.,47   INT. JENOLEN (OPTICAL),JENOLEN,INT.,Relics,1992-08-04,The Next Generation,230.txt
326,GEORDI,"       Hailing is standard procedure   today, too...",47   INT. JENOLEN (OPTICAL),JENOLEN,INT.,Relics,1992-08-04,The Next Generation,230.txt
327,GEORDI,"   Scotty, what if these aren't   communications arrays... what   if they're access terminals...   which are triggered by subspace   signals on certain frequencies...",47   INT. JENOLEN (OPTICAL),JENOLEN,INT.,Relics,1992-08-04,The Next Generation,230.txt
328,SCOTT,   Frequencies like our standard   ship's hail.,47   INT. JENOLEN (OPTICAL),JENOLEN,INT.,Relics,1992-08-04,The Next Generation,230.txt
329,GEORDI,   Exactly. When the Enterprise   saw this terminal they probably   did the same thing you did   seventy-five years ago -- opened   a channel. Only this time it   triggered something which   activated that hatch and pulled   the ship inside the sphere.,47   INT. JENOLEN (OPTICAL),JENOLEN,INT.,Relics,1992-08-04,The Next Generation,230.txt
330,SCOTT,"   A nice bit of reasoning, Lad...   very nice indeed.",47   INT. JENOLEN (OPTICAL),JENOLEN,INT.,Relics,1992-08-04,The Next Generation,230.txt
331,GEORDI,"   We could trigger the hatch, but   we'd probably be pulled in like   they were.",47   INT. JENOLEN (OPTICAL),JENOLEN,INT.,Relics,1992-08-04,The Next Generation,230.txt
332,SCOTT,   Maybe all we need to do is get   our foot in the door.,47   INT. JENOLEN (OPTICAL),JENOLEN,INT.,Relics,1992-08-04,The Next Generation,230.txt
333,SCOTT,"   If we trigger the hatch with a   subspace transmission, we might   not be pulled inside if we keep   our distance from the sphere --   say a half million kilometers.   Then, when the hatch starts to   close again, we move in, and use   the Jenolen to jam the hatch open   and hope the Enterprise can   escape.",47   INT. JENOLEN (OPTICAL),JENOLEN,INT.,Relics,1992-08-04,The Next Generation,230.txt
334,GEORDI,   You can't be serious. That hatch   is huge. It could crush this ship   like an egg.,47   INT. JENOLEN (OPTICAL),JENOLEN,INT.,Relics,1992-08-04,The Next Generation,230.txt
335,SCOTT,"   The shields will hold Lad, don't   you worry about that. I know how   to get a few extra gigawatts out   of these babies.",47   INT. JENOLEN (OPTICAL),JENOLEN,INT.,Relics,1992-08-04,The Next Generation,230.txt
336,GEORDI,       Scotty. This is crazy. I am not   going to let you---,47   INT. JENOLEN (OPTICAL),JENOLEN,INT.,Relics,1992-08-04,The Next Generation,230.txt
337,SCOTT,   Geordi. I've spent my whole life   figuring out how to make crazy   things work.       I'm telling you... one engineer   to another... I can do this.,47   INT. JENOLEN (OPTICAL),JENOLEN,INT.,Relics,1992-08-04,The Next Generation,230.txt

341,GEORDI,   Okay. Here we go.,49   INT. JENOLEN,JENOLEN,INT.,Relics,1992-08-04,The Next Generation,230.txt
342,GEORDI,   Come on... there's nothing out   here... give it up.       I still can't open a channel to   the Enterprise... there's too much   interference. We'll have to to   wait until we're right in the   doorway.,51A  INT. JENOLEN,JENOLEN,INT.,Relics,1992-08-04,The Next Generation,230.txt

349,GEORDI,"       I've lost helm control...       La Forge to Enterprise. Captain,   we won't be able to move this ship   out of the way when you get   here... you're going to have to   destroy it in order to escape.",55B  INT. JENOLEN,JENOLEN,INT.,Relics,1992-08-04,The Next Generation,230.txt
