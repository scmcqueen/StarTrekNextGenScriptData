5,BEVERLY,"   Data's away on assignment. A   Federation deep space probe went   off course and crashed on Barkon   Four.

11,BEVERLY,   I volunteered tonight. I like to   get in a little Bridge time now   and then... stay on top of   operations... tactical   procedures...       And the truth is... I like it.
