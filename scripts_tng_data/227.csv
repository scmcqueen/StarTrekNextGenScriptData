0,CLEMENS,"   I have long been interested in   the notion of time travel. In   fact, I wrote a book about it...   It chronicled the tale of a man   from our era who fouled the sixth   century by introducing newfangled   gadgets and weapons... all in the   name of Progress.       The idea of time travelers isn't   so far fetched as it seems...   in fact, I have learned that, even   now, people from the future are   right here in San Francisco...   and I have no doubt that they are   intent on fouling our world...   just like my Yankee did in King   Arthur's time.       Well. Let me serve notice: as   soon as I get the necessary   evidence, I intend to expose   them... and make it absolutely   clear that they are not welcome   here.",1    EXT. S.F.
