1,JULIANA,"   Captain, our situation has   worsened since my husband and I   first contacted you. The molten   core of our planet is not just   cooling -- it's begun to solidify.",2    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL),OBSERVATION LOUNGE,INT.,Inheritance,1993-09-27,The Next Generation,262.txt
2,PRAN,   Our gravitational field has been   affected -- seismic activity has   increased by a factor of three.,2    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL),OBSERVATION LOUNGE,INT.,Inheritance,1993-09-27,The Next Generation,262.txt
3,JULIANA,   If the cooling continues at this   rate -- Atrea will become   uninhabitable within thirteen   months.,2    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL),OBSERVATION LOUNGE,INT.,Inheritance,1993-09-27,The Next Generation,262.txt
4,GEORDI,   We could minimize seismic activity   by creating isobaric fissures and   releasing some of the tectonic   stress -- but that would just be   a temporary fix.,2    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL),OBSERVATION LOUNGE,INT.,Inheritance,1993-09-27,The Next Generation,262.txt
