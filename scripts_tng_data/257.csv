296,RIKER,   I'm sorry. It's been a difficult   couple of days.       I know that one of your operatives   has been investigating the   assembly of the psionic resonator   on a mercenary ship for several   months. I didn't want someone to   make a mistake and start firing at   them when they approach your   planet.,33   INT. READY ROOM (OPTICAL),READY ROOM,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt
297,SATOK,"   Commander, I believe there is a   problem.       We have no operative aboard a   mercenary ship.",33   INT. READY ROOM (OPTICAL),READY ROOM,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt

299,TALLERA,   I know that place. It was an   underground stronghold for one of   the factions during the last civil   war. It's been abandoned for   centuries.,34   INT. BARAN'S QUARTERS,BARAN'S QUARTERS,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt

302,PICARD,       Perhaps you can help me with   something... I've been able to   translate most of the writing on   these pieces...,34   INT. BARAN'S QUARTERS,BARAN'S QUARTERS,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt

304,PICARD,   But this hieroglyph on the   anterior has me a bit puzzled.,34   INT. BARAN'S QUARTERS,BARAN'S QUARTERS,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt
305,PICARD,   This is clearly the Vulcan god of   war... and this is the god of   death...,34   INT. BARAN'S QUARTERS,BARAN'S QUARTERS,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt
306,PICARD,"   But if you look closely you can   see that there is a third symbol   missing -- which should be on the   final piece. The odd thing is   that typically, the gods of war   and death would stand alone on an   artifact... they would never be   combined with a third glyph.",34   INT. BARAN'S QUARTERS,BARAN'S QUARTERS,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt
307,TALLERA,   Fascinating. But I am not an   archaeological expert.,34   INT. BARAN'S QUARTERS,BARAN'S QUARTERS,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt
308,PICARD,   Hmmmm. I'm anxious to see the   final artifact... it may provide   a new insight into Vulcan   mythology.,34   INT. BARAN'S QUARTERS,BARAN'S QUARTERS,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt
309,TALLERA,"   When we arrive at Vulcan, I will   take these pieces to a secure   holding area before going to the   Sanctuary. I prefer to go   alone... it will arouse less   suspicion among the isolationists.",34   INT. BARAN'S QUARTERS,BARAN'S QUARTERS,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt
310,PICARD,       We shouldn't have any problems   entering orbit.     ,34   INT. BARAN'S QUARTERS,BARAN'S QUARTERS,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt

313,TALLERA,       It was a wise precaution.,34   INT. BARAN'S QUARTERS,BARAN'S QUARTERS,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt
314,PICARD,   Perhaps I should contact the   Enterprise... have them meet us   at Vulcan in case these   isolationists try to escape.,34   INT. BARAN'S QUARTERS,BARAN'S QUARTERS,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt

316,PICARD,"   I see.       Are you sure it's wise for you to   go to the Sanctuary alone? After   all, they're expecting Baran to   show up, not you.

321,PICARD,"   Tallera... I've decided on a   change of plan. Leave one   artifact here for now. Take the   other... and once we have our   payment in hand, we'll complete   the delivery.",36   INT. MERCENARY SHIP - BRIDGE,MERCENARY SHI,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt
322,TALLERA,   That was not the agreement.,36   INT. MERCENARY SHIP - BRIDGE,MERCENARY SHI,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt
323,PICARD,   I realize that. But it would be   safer for all concerned if we kept   one piece here.,36   INT. MERCENARY SHIP - BRIDGE,MERCENARY SHI,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt
324,TALLERA,   They will not pay us until they   get both pieces.,36   INT. MERCENARY SHIP - BRIDGE,MERCENARY SHI,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt
325,PICARD,   They've waited a long time for   this. They won't take any risks   at this stage. Take the piece and   beam down.,36   INT. MERCENARY SHIP - BRIDGE,MERCENARY SHI,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt

327,TALLERA,"       Go to the navigational computer   and check file one-three-seven-slash-omega.

329,TALLERA,   That message was sent by Galen...   he's a Starfleet officer.,36   INT. MERCENARY SHIP - BRIDGE,MERCENARY SHI,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt
330,NARIK,       Why didn't you tell us before?,36   INT. MERCENARY SHIP - BRIDGE,MERCENARY SHI,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt
331,TALLERA,   I wasn't sure until he tried to   stop me from taking the artifacts   to the surface. Then I knew he   was intentionally obstructing our   plans to keep us from being paid.,36   INT. MERCENARY SHIP - BRIDGE,MERCENARY SHI,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt
332,PICARD,"   Tallera's right, I am a Starfleet   officer... but what she's not   telling you is that those   artifacts in her hand are part of   an incredibly powerful weapon.   There's no reward waiting for you   down on the surface. Tallera will   take the artifacts and leave you   here, to be captured by Starfleet.",36   INT.

333,TALLERA,   I've served on this ship for   almost a year now... fought by   your sides... protected you from   Baran when I could... and now I've   exposed a spy in our midst.       I think I've proven my loyalty.,36   INT. MERCENARY SHIP - BRIDGE,MERCENARY SHI,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt
334,PICARD,       You know Tallera... you know she's   a woman of great patience. She's   bided her time and waited for this   moment. All she cares about is   assembling that weapon. If she   leaves this ship you'll never see   her again.,36   INT. MERCENARY SHIP - BRIDGE,MERCENARY SHI,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt
335,VEKOR,"       I don't care what it is you want,   Tallera. I don't care if that's   a weapon for your private use or   if you're really just making a   delivery as planned. All I care   about is my money.       So I propose a compromise. Narik   and I will go with you to the   surface to guarantee we receive   payment. After that, you can go   wherever you want.",36   INT. MERCENARY SHIP - BRIDGE,MERCENARY SHI,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt
336,TALLERA,   Agreed.       Bring him as well. We can use him   as a hostage if Starfleet   arrives... if not we'll kill him   on the surface.,36   INT. MERCENARY SHIP - BRIDGE,MERCENARY SHI,INT.,"Gambit, Part II",1993-08-06,The Next Generation,257.txt

349,PICARD,       That's why you wanted me to take   the phaser -- and why you were   able to kill Narik and Vekor. It   wasn't until I saw the image on   the last artifact... that I   realized what the message on the   resonator was.       The third image is the Vulcan   symbol for peace... that symbol is   positioned between the symbols for   war and death.     ,37   INT.

354,PICARD,"   Think, Tallera -- two thousand   years ago, your people were being   consumed by war... then they found   the way of peace and logic.   During the same period, the   resonator was dismantled... don't   you see the connection?       When peace came to Vulcan, the   resonator became useless. That is   why it was dismantled.",37   INT.
