48,BEVERLY,    (leaping in to diffuse     this)   Doctor Reyga has offered to   demonstrate his invention. He's   outfitted one of our shuttles with   the metaphasic shield.,5    INT. SCIENCE LAB,SCIENCE LAB,INT.,Suspicions,1993-02-25,The Next Generation,248.txt
49,REYGA,   I will take it into the corona of   the star Vaytan.,5    INT. SCIENCE LAB,SCIENCE LAB,INT.,Suspicions,1993-02-25,The Next Generation,248.txt
50,CHRISTOPHER,   That star has a superdense corona.   The shuttle would be subjected to   particularly intense radiation.   Perhaps it would be wise to choose   a star of lesser magnitude.,5    INT. SCIENCE LAB,SCIENCE LAB,INT.,Suspicions,1993-02-25,The Next Generation,248.txt

68,REYGA,   If there's anything I'm used to --   it's skepticism.       After all -- a Ferengi scientist   is almost a contradiction in   terms.,6    INT. CORRIDOR,CORRIDOR,INT.,Suspicions,1993-02-25,The Next Generation,248.txt

72,BEVERLY,   You mean jealousy.       I know. I wondered if that might   account for Doctor T'Pan's   attitude. She's been working on   subspace shielding technology for   years. And you've beaten her to   the punch.,6    INT. CORRIDOR,CORRIDOR,INT.,Suspicions,1993-02-25,The Next Generation,248.txt
