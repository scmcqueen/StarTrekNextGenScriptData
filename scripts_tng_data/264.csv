308,SIROL,   Captain... you seem to be in a   very... unfortunate circumstance.   How can we help?,32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
309,PICARD,   Are you responsible for this?,32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
310,SIROL,"   I'm not sure. We were conducting   some... geological experiments on   the surface of the asteroid. It's   possible that we... accidently   sealed you in.       If only we had known you were   beneath the surface... if you had   shared your plans with us, this   might have been avoided.",32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
311,PICARD,"   What is it you want, Sirol?",32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
312,SIROL,"   I don't want anything, Captain.   But I will offer to help you.",32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
313,RIKER,   How?,32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
314,SIROL,"       By transporting your crew aboard   my ship. We'll take you back to   Romulus... where after a short   stay as our guests, you will be   returned to the Federation.",32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
315,PICARD,   Thank you for your... generous   offer. I will... take it under   advisement.,32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
316,SIROL,   As you wish. We'll be continuing   our... research in this system for   a while longer. I await your   decision.,32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
317,PRESSMAN,   We can't do it. If we abandon the   Enterprise they'll come back here   and get their hands on both ships.,32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
318,PICARD,   Agreed. Options?,32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
319,WORF,   We could use the phasers to cut   our way out.,32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
320,DATA,   The asteroid's internal structure   is highly unstable. Any attempt   to cut through the rock could   cause the entire chasm to   collapse.,32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
321,RIKER,   Captain... I have a suggestion.   There's a piece of equipment under   guard in Admiral Pressman's   quarters which could get us out of   here.       It's a prototype for a Federation   cloaking device.,32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
322,PRESSMAN,"       You just ended your career, Wil.",32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
323,PICARD,   That's what this is all about? A   cloaking device? In the Treaty of   Algeron the Federation   specifically agreed not to develop   cloaking technology.,32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
324,PRESSMAN,   And that treaty is the biggest   mistake we ever made. It's kept   us from exploiting a vital area of   defense that--,32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
325,PICARD,"       That treaty has kept the peace for   sixty years. And as a Starfleet   officer, you are sworn to uphold   it.",32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
326,PRESSMAN,"   That's enough. I'm taking command   of this vessel. Mister Worf,   escort the Captain to his   quarters.",32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
327,RIKER,       I don't think anyone's going to   come to your defense this time.,32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
328,PICARD,       How can we use the cloak to escape   the asteroid?,32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
329,RIKER,"   It's more than just a cloak. It   changes the structure of matter...   in theory, a ship using this   device would be able to pass   through normal matter.",32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
330,PICARD,       That's why you were so eager to   find it...,32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
331,PRESSMAN,   Can't you see the potential here?   The phasing cloak could be the   greatest breakthrough in weapons   research in the last fifty years.,32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
332,PICARD,   Except it's illegal... it's a   violation of an agreement the   Federation signed in good faith.,32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
333,RIKER,   Captain... we might be able to   adapt the cloak for the Enterprise   engines and use it to escape the   asteroid.,32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
334,PICARD,   Mister Data?,32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
335,DATA,"   It is theoretically possible, sir.   But it will take several hours to   study the device and determine how   to link it to our systems.",32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
336,PICARD,   Make it so.,32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
337,PICARD ,   Captain's Log: Stardate 47457.1.   We have been trapped inside the   asteroid for over eight hours.   Mister Data and Commander La Forge   inform me that they are nearly   ready to engage the cloak.,34   EXT.

338,GEORDI,"       Commander, I've routed the impulse   engines through the warp plasma   conduits... but you'll have to   watch the intercooler levels... if   they go too high, we'll blow out   the entire relay system.",35   INT. MAIN ENGINEERING,MAIN ENGINEERING,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
339,RIKER,"       Understood.       I think that's what happened   twelve years ago. The cloak blew   out the plasma relays on the   Pegasus after we left the ship...   the plasma ignited in space, and   it looked like the ship had been   destroyed.",36   INT. MAIN BRIDGE,MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
340,PRESSMAN,       So the ship drifted into this   system... still in a phased   state... and when it passed   through this asteroid...,36   INT. MAIN BRIDGE,MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
341,RIKER,   The cloak failed. And half the   ship materialized in solid rock.,36   INT. MAIN BRIDGE,MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt

346,RIKER,   The cloak appears to be   functioning normally. The ship's   matter/energy phasing rate should   be sufficient to pass through the   asteroid.,44   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL),MAIN BRIDGE,INT.,The Pegasus,1993-10-18,The Next Generation,264.txt
