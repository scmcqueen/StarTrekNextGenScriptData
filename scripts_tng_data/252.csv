324,RIKER,   I've sent out twelve teams so far.    (points to console     screen)   I've assigned your team to search   section gamma two-five.

331,GEORDI,       And then we could home in on that   response with our tricorders. I   thought about that. The problem   is that the pulse would have to be   so powerful that it would probably   destroy Data's entire positronic   net in the process.,66   EXT.

336,GEORDI,   I don't think so. There aren't   any Borg energy signatures.    (looks at tricorder for     a moment)   There's a door or a hatch or   something about twenty meters that   way.,69   EXT.
