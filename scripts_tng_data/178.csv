378,JACK,"   Hello, Wesley. As I make this   recording, you're just ten weeks   old.       I want you to know who I am today.   You see, this Jack Crusher won't   exist by the time you're grown   up... I'll be older, more   experienced... hopefully a little   wiser. But this person will be   gone and I wanted you to know who   I am now, who your father was when   you came into this world.       I see you lying there in your   crib... and I realize that I don't   know the first thing about being   a father. So let me just   apologize for all the mistakes   I'm about to make as you grow up.    (disturbed by the     thought)   I hope you don't grow up...   resenting the fact that I was gone   so much. That comes with this   uniform. Right now, I'm waiting   for an assignment on the U.S.S.   Stargazer. I don't know if I can   explain why Starfleet is so   important to me... maybe you'll   understand when you get this...   later on.       Maybe you'll even want to try one   of these on.    (thinks, gives up,     laughs a little)   You'll probably be a doctor like   your mother.       We named you after Richard Wesley   Crusher, my grandfather, who gave   me my first flying lesson as a   boy. You come from a fine   family... of scholars, explorers,   artists... your great-great   grandfather was a painter whose   work once hung in the Prado...     ",34   INT. HOLODECK,HOLODECK,INT.,"""Family""",1990-08-02,The Next Generation
379,JACK ,"   We've had a skeleton or two in   our closet... someday, I'll tell   you about the Crusher who was a   horse thief on Nimbus Three...   but we also had our share of   family heroes... a Crusher fought   for the Confederacy at Bull Run.   One died at Station Salem One.   It's a proud heritage, Wesley...   one for you to pass on to your   children.     ",34   INT. HOLODECK,HOLODECK,INT.,"""Family""",1990-08-02,The Next Generation
380,JACK ,"       You're only a baby... but it's   remarkable... I see in your face   all the people I've loved in my   lifetime... your mother... my   father and mother... our family.   I see me in you, too. I can   feel that you're my son. I don't   know how to describe it...   There's this connection, this   bond... I will always be a part   of you, Wes...       Well, I hope this made some sense   to you... I'm not sure it does   to me. Maybe I'll do better next   time. I love you, Wesley.",34   INT.
