340,RIKER,       Did they send the right shuttle?,54   INT. SHUTTLEBAY,SHUTTLEBAY,INT.,Parallels,1993-10-07,The Next Generation,263.txt
341,DATA,   Yes. Its quantum signature   matches Commander Worf's   precisely.       I have re-modulated the shuttle's   engines to emit an inverse warp   field. You will need to activate   the field at the precise moment   you enter the fissure.,54   INT. SHUTTLEBAY,SHUTTLEBAY,INT.,Parallels,1993-10-07,The Next Generation,263.txt

343,DATA,"   That is one possibility. However,   the uncertainty principle dictates   that time is a variable in this   equation.
