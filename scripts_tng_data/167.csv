360,VASH,   Jean-Luc -- I was just about to   come say good-bye.,48   INT. LOBBY - NIGHT,LOBBY,INT.,"""Captain's Holiday""",1990-01-21,The Next Generation

362,VASH,   I want to put all this behind me   as soon as possible. You   understand.,48   INT. LOBBY - NIGHT,LOBBY,INT.,"""Captain's Holiday""",1990-01-21,The Next Generation
363,PICARD,"   Of course. However, there is one   last thing you can do for me.",48   INT. LOBBY - NIGHT,LOBBY,INT.,"""Captain's Holiday""",1990-01-21,The Next Generation

367,PICARD,"   You never intended to burn that   second disc. If you had, you   wouldn't have been so careless   as to allow Sovak to salvage any   of it. You wanted him to follow   us so he could see for himself   that the Uthat wasn't at the cave   site. It was the only way to   convince him your quest had been   futile.",48   INT. LOBBY - NIGHT,LOBBY,INT.,"""Captain's Holiday""",1990-01-21,The Next Generation
368,VASH,   But how could I have known the   Uthat wasn't there?,48   INT. LOBBY - NIGHT,LOBBY,INT.,"""Captain's Holiday""",1990-01-21,The Next Generation
369,PICARD,   Because you had gone there once   before. Probably the moment you   arrived on the planet. That's   when you found it.,48   INT. LOBBY - NIGHT,LOBBY,INT.,"""Captain's Holiday""",1990-01-21,The Next Generation

373,PICARD,   A very dangerous piece. Were you   really going to give it to the   Daystom Institute?,48   INT. LOBBY - NIGHT,LOBBY,INT.,"""Captain's Holiday""",1990-01-21,The Next Generation
374,VASH,"   Well, maybe not give it.       Five years is a huge investment,   Jean-Luc. I deserve to make a   reasonable profit.",48   INT. LOBBY - NIGHT,LOBBY,INT.,"""Captain's Holiday""",1990-01-21,The Next Generation
