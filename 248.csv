1,BEVERLY,"   Alright, come in.","""Suspicions"""
2,BEVERLY,   Guinan... ? What are you doing   here?,"""Suspicions"""
3,GUINAN,   I need a doctor.,"""Suspicions"""
4,GUINAN,   Geordi beat me in straight sets   today.       I think I've got a case of tennis   elbow.,"""Suspicions"""
5,BEVERLY,   Go to Sickbay. I think Doctor   Selar is on duty.,"""Suspicions"""
6,GUINAN,   I don't want to see Selar. I   always see you. I'm particular   about my doctors.,"""Suspicions"""
7,BEVERLY,"   Well, you'd better get a new   one... because I'm not a doctor   on this ship anymore.","""Suspicions"""
8,BEVERLY,"       Three days on the shuttle to   Starbase twenty-three... then a   transport back to Earth... I can   hear Admiral Brooks now, telling   me how I've disgraced Starfleet   Medical...       Then a leisurely day and a half   before the formal inquiry begins   and my career ends.","""Suspicions"""
9,GUINAN,       Beverly.,"""Suspicions"""
10,GUINAN,   My elbow.,"""Suspicions"""
11,BEVERLY,   Your elbow... ?,"""Suspicions"""
12,BEVERLY,"   Alright, let me see it...","""Suspicions"""
13,BEVERLY,   Does that hurt?,"""Suspicions"""
14,GUINAN,"   Yeah, right there...","""Suspicions"""
15,BEVERLY,"   Tennis elbow, alright. Hold it   like this...","""Suspicions"""
16,GUINAN,   I've never been to a formal   inquiry.,"""Suspicions"""
17,BEVERLY,   It's no big thing. Any doctor can   have one... all you have to do is   disobey orders... violate medical   ethics... cause an interstellar   incident...,"""Suspicions"""
18,GUINAN,"   That would do it, all right.","""Suspicions"""
19,BEVERLY,       Make a fist.,"""Suspicions"""
20,GUINAN,   Do I have to break my leg before   you tell me what happened?,"""Suspicions"""
21,BEVERLY,"   It started when I invited those   scientists on board...       No. It started at the Altine   Consortium.       Actually, it probably started   before that. When I began   feeling... comfortable.","""Suspicions"""
22,GUINAN,   Comfortable?,"""Suspicions"""
23,BEVERLY,   Too comfortable.,"""Suspicions"""
24,GUINAN,   Ah.,"""Suspicions"""
25,BEVERLY,       That's why I went to the Altine   Conference... to hear the latest   bio-physical theories. Maybe find   a new area of research. And   that's where I met Doctor Reyga...   nobody would listen to him -- just   because he was a Ferengi. They   all but jeered him off the   stage...,"""Suspicions"""
26,GUINAN,   So you invited the scientists on   board... to listen to this Doctor   Reyga...,"""Suspicions"""
27,BEVERLY,"   I thought I could be a...   facilitator. You see, he had this   amazing invention, based on   metaphasic field technology. But   his methodology was completely   unorthodox.","""Suspicions"""
28,GUINAN,   That's my favorite kind.,"""Suspicions"""
29,BEVERLY,"   I thought... if I could bring   scientists from various cultures   aboard the Enterprise... sit them   down... help them understand the   value of his ideas... well, it   seemed like the right thing to do.","""Suspicions"""
30,GUINAN,   Sort of a scientific diplomat.,"""Suspicions"""
31,BEVERLY,"   That's it exactly. And believe   me, it wasn't easy.","""Suspicions"""
32,BEVERLY,   I had to persuade Captain   Picard... and then I had to round   up as many scientists as I could   in the field of subspace   technology...,"""Suspicions"""
33,BEVERLY ,"   ... but of all the scientists I   invited, only four were interested   in hearing about Doctor Reyga's   invention.","""Suspicions"""
34,BEVERLY ,   Kurak was a warp field specialist   on the Klingon Homeworld. I don't   think Klingons regard scientists   very highly... she always seemed   a little defensive.,"""Suspicions"""
35,BEVERLY ,"   Doctor T'Pan is practically a   legend in the field of subspace   morphology. She's been the   director of the Vulcan Science   Academy for fifteen years...       Her husband, Doctor Christopher,   came with her... I didn't know   much about him... but he was some   kind of a subspace theoretician.","""Suspicions"""
36,BEVERLY ,   Jo'Bril was a Takaran... the first   one I'd ever met. I had no idea   what to expect from him.,"""Suspicions"""
37,BEVERLY ,   And then there was Doctor Reyga...   the Ferengi scientist.,"""Suspicions"""
38,REYGA,   You've all seen my experimental   data. The metaphasic shield has   been proven.,"""Suspicions"""
39,T'PAN,"   Forgive my skepticism, Doctor, but   your claims are somewhat   extravagant. Protect a shuttle   within a star's corona? Not even   your own government believes it   can be done.","""Suspicions"""
40,BEVERLY,   That's why I've asked you all to   come here. I think you have the   vision to see the potential in   Doctor Reyga's metaphasic shield.,"""Suspicions"""
41,REYGA,   I need help to develop the shield.   I am willing to grant exclusive   rights to whoever provides the   necessary resources.,"""Suspicions"""
42,BEVERLY,   I think you all realize what this   shielding process would mean...   the possibilities for exploration   and research are endless...,"""Suspicions"""
43,KURAK,   But only if it works.       I'm not convinced this metaphasic   shield can withstand either the   temperature or the radiation it   would be exposed to.,"""Suspicions"""
44,REYGA,"   But it has -- not only in   countless simulations, but in a   field test that I conducted   myself.","""Suspicions"""
45,KURAK,"   For which, of course, we have only   your word...","""Suspicions"""
46,REYGA,   Are you accusing me of falsifying   my data?,"""Suspicions"""
47,KURAK,       You wouldn't be the first   scientist to manipulate   experimental data to his own   advantage...,"""Suspicions"""
48,BEVERLY,    (leaping in to diffuse     this)   Doctor Reyga has offered to   demonstrate his invention. He's   outfitted one of our shuttles with   the metaphasic shield.,"""Suspicions"""
49,REYGA,   I will take it into the corona of   the star Vaytan.,"""Suspicions"""
50,CHRISTOPHER,   That star has a superdense corona.   The shuttle would be subjected to   particularly intense radiation.   Perhaps it would be wise to choose   a star of lesser magnitude.,"""Suspicions"""
51,T'PAN,   I agree. My own research into   solar energy transfer suggests   that Vaytan's corona is extremely   unstable.,"""Suspicions"""
52,REYGA,       What better way to test my   invention? I'm not concerned --   the shield will hold.,"""Suspicions"""
53,KURAK,"   I, for one, would feel more   comfortable if someone else flew   the shuttle. Someone more --   objective.","""Suspicions"""
54,JO'BRIL,   I will volunteer for that task.,"""Suspicions"""
55,JO'BRIL,   I've spent years studying solar   plasma reactions. The thought of   being able to penetrate a star's   corona... it's a remarkable   opportunity.       I've studied your data. I think   you're on solid scientific ground.,"""Suspicions"""
56,KURAK,"   I don't share your optimism,   Doctor Jo'Bril... but if you wish   to pilot the craft, I would be   more confident about your   assessment of the shield... than   Doctor Reyga's.","""Suspicions"""
57,CHRISTOPHER,"   I agree. At this point, we need   an impartial evaluation.","""Suspicions"""
58,BEVERLY,   We'd want to be sure that you're   familiar with the shuttle   controls... and Doctor Reyga's   modifications...,"""Suspicions"""
59,JO'BRIL,       I'm an accomplished pilot. It   will be no problem.,"""Suspicions"""
60,BEVERLY,   Well...       What do you think?,"""Suspicions"""
61,REYGA,   Doctor Jo'Bril... I am gratified.   And there will be no difficulty   operating the metaphasic controls --   the system will activate   automatically as you approach the   star.,"""Suspicions"""
62,BEVERLY,"   Well, then. We'll proceed with   the demonstration at fifteen   hundred hours. We'll meet on the   Bridge.","""Suspicions"""
63,BEVERLY,"   I think that went well, don't you?","""Suspicions"""
64,REYGA,"   Thanks to you, Doctor.","""Suspicions"""
65,BEVERLY,   I didn't do anything...,"""Suspicions"""
66,REYGA,"   This is an opportunity I would   never have had without you, and I   promise you I'll never forget it.","""Suspicions"""
67,BEVERLY,   Some of those scientists are still   a little doubtful... but after the   demonstration I'm sure they'll   come around.,"""Suspicions"""
68,REYGA,   If there's anything I'm used to --   it's skepticism.       After all -- a Ferengi scientist   is almost a contradiction in   terms.,"""Suspicions"""
69,REYGA,"   No, don't deny it. I know how the   Ferengi are regarded...","""Suspicions"""
70,BEVERLY,   I'd still expect the scientific   community to be more open-minded   than they seem to be.,"""Suspicions"""
71,REYGA,   The metaphasic shield is a   breakthrough in technology... many   scientists have tried to develop   it. It's only natural there would   be some... resistance...,"""Suspicions"""
72,BEVERLY,   You mean jealousy.       I know. I wondered if that might   account for Doctor T'Pan's   attitude. She's been working on   subspace shielding technology for   years. And you've beaten her to   the punch.,"""Suspicions"""
73,REYGA,   I'm really not interested in   competition. All I want is to be   acknowledged... respected as a   scientist. This invention will   finally do that.,"""Suspicions"""
74,BEVERLY ,"   As far as I was concerned, the   hard part was over. I'd stepped   out on a limb... and it hadn't   broken.","""Suspicions"""
75,BEVERLY ,   Not bad for my first venture into   scientific diplomacy.,"""Suspicions"""
76,DATA,"   Captain, the shuttle has been   launched.","""Suspicions"""
77,PICARD,   On screen. Open a channel.,"""Suspicions"""
78,JO'BRIL,   I'm one million kilometers from   the star's corona... proceeding at   three quarters impulse... I should   reach it in approximately three   minutes.,"""Suspicions"""
79,REYGA,       The metaphasic shielding has begun   to form.,"""Suspicions"""
80,DATA,   External temperature is zero-pointnine   million Kelvins and rising.   Radiation levels are nearing ten   thousand rads.,"""Suspicions"""
81,REYGA,   That should have no effect on the   shuttle cabin...,"""Suspicions"""
82,BEVERLY,   That's right. Cabin temperature   is twenty-one degrees celcius.   Radiation levels are normal.,"""Suspicions"""
83,JO'BRIL,   Wait -- I'm reading elevated   neutriono levels in the cabin...,"""Suspicions"""
84,REYGA,   Those are from the subspace field   that's encapsulating the shuttle.   The levels are well within   acceptable parameters.,"""Suspicions"""
85,DATA,   Outside temperature is rising   rapidly -- one-point-seven million   Kelvins.,"""Suspicions"""
86,BEVERLY,   Cabin temperature is still twenty-one   degrees. The shield is   holding...,"""Suspicions"""
87,JO'BRIL,   I'm nearing the corona... Three   hundred fifty thousand kilometers   and closing... this is   incredible... I'm actually flying   into a star...,"""Suspicions"""
88,PICARD,"       Congratulations, Doctor. This is   an amazing achievement.","""Suspicions"""
89,DATA,   Radiation levels outside the   shuttle are nearing fourteen   thousand rads.,"""Suspicions"""
90,BEVERLY,       But they're normal inside the   cabin.,"""Suspicions"""
91,JO'BRIL,   I'm now fully engulfed in the   corona... it's astonishing...,"""Suspicions"""
92,REYGA,"   You see, Doctors? Metaphasic   shielding is a reality.","""Suspicions"""
93,REYGA,"   Doctor Jo'Bril, can you give us an   estimate of the plasma turbulence?","""Suspicions"""
94,REYGA,   Doctor Jo'Bril... ?,"""Suspicions"""
95,BEVERLY,   Something's wrong.,"""Suspicions"""
96,RIKER,"   Mister Data, what's going on?","""Suspicions"""
97,DATA,   Sensors indicate an increased   level of baryon particles in the   cabin.,"""Suspicions"""
98,REYGA,   No... that's not possible...,"""Suspicions"""
99,PICARD,"   Doctor Jo'Bril, can you hear us?   Please respond.","""Suspicions"""
100,DATA,   Baryon levels are continuing to   rise...,"""Suspicions"""
101,REYGA,   I don't understand it... this   shouldn't be happening...,"""Suspicions"""
102,PICARD,"   Mister Worf, can we beam him out   of there?","""Suspicions"""
103,WORF,       The solar radiation is   interfering... he must be at   least five-hundred thousand   kilometers from the star before we   can get a Transporter lock.,"""Suspicions"""
104,PICARD,   Doctor Jo'Bril... listen to me.   It is imperative that you turn the   shuttle... take it out of the   corona...       Do you understand what I'm saying?,"""Suspicions"""
105,PICARD,   Pilot the shuttle away from the   star...,"""Suspicions"""
106,BEVERLY,   We're losing him...,"""Suspicions"""
107,DATA,"   The shuttle is emerging from the   corona, sir.","""Suspicions"""
108,PICARD,"   Get a lock on him as soon as you   can, Mister Worf.","""Suspicions"""
109,BEVERLY,   Beam him directly to Sickbay.,"""Suspicions"""
110,BEVERLY,   Twenty cc's inoprovaline...,"""Suspicions"""
111,BEVERLY,   That's not doing it. Cortical   stimulators.,"""Suspicions"""
112,BEVERLY,   Again.,"""Suspicions"""
113,JO'BRIL,       I saw... the sun...,"""Suspicions"""
114,BEVERLY,   So that was my first experience as   a scientific diplomat.       A complete failure. I don't think   I've ever felt so awful.,"""Suspicions"""
115,BEVERLY,       I don't understand it.,"""Suspicions"""
116,GUINAN,   No?,"""Suspicions"""
117,BEVERLY,   I mean... I've lost people   before... patients...,"""Suspicions"""
118,GUINAN,   But this was different.,"""Suspicions"""
119,BEVERLY,   Yes. But I don't know why.,"""Suspicions"""
120,GUINAN,   If I had to hazard a guess... I'd   say that when you're dealing with   a patient... you feel like you're   in control.,"""Suspicions"""
121,BEVERLY,   I guess so...,"""Suspicions"""
122,GUINAN,"   Your training, your experience...   it's all there, at your   fingertips. So even if you   fail... you know you've done the   best you can do.","""Suspicions"""
123,GUINAN,       But once you send someone on a   dangerous mission... all you can   do is watch.,"""Suspicions"""
124,BEVERLY,   I felt... helpless...,"""Suspicions"""
125,GUINAN,   Don't you think anyone would have?   Maybe you're being a little hard   on yourself.,"""Suspicions"""
126,BEVERLY,   But Guinan... that wasn't the end.   You don't know the half of it.,"""Suspicions"""
127,PICARD,   How's it going?,"""Suspicions"""
128,BEVERLY,   I've never run into a humanoid   species like this...,"""Suspicions"""
129,BEVERLY,"   His internal physiology is   baffling. He doesn't seem to have   discrete ""organs""... at least not   in the traditional sense...   practically every system is evenly   distributed throughout his body.","""Suspicions"""
130,BEVERLY,   That kind of physiology should   make him incredibly resistant to   injury... so whatever killed him   had to occur at the cellular   level...,"""Suspicions"""
131,PICARD,   Do you have any idea what it was?,"""Suspicions"""
132,BEVERLY,"   No. Something caused a massive,   system-wide failure... but I don't   know what.","""Suspicions"""
133,PICARD,   Were the solar radiation levels   high enough to have killed him?,"""Suspicions"""
134,BEVERLY,       His exposure to the star's   radiation was minimal. It's all   very strange...,"""Suspicions"""
135,OGAWA,"   Doctor, here's the result of the   tissue scan you asked for.","""Suspicions"""
136,BEVERLY,   That's odd... his rate of cellular   decay is extremely low...,"""Suspicions"""
137,PICARD,"   The answers will come, Beverly...","""Suspicions"""
138,BEVERLY,       Maybe even minimal exposure to   radiation altered his physiology   at the cellular level...,"""Suspicions"""
139,PICARD,   You've been at this for hours...   You might think more clearly if   you get a good night's sleep.,"""Suspicions"""
140,BEVERLY,   I couldn't close my eyes. I have   to find out what killed him. I   owe that to Doctor Reyga.,"""Suspicions"""
141,PICARD,   Are you doing it for Reyga... or   yourself?,"""Suspicions"""
142,BEVERLY,   What do you mean?,"""Suspicions"""
143,PICARD,"   You're the loneliest person in the   world right now... no one can say   anything... no one can do anything   that will help. You don't think   it'll ever go away.       And you're right. It never does.   But you can live with it. It   doesn't feel that way now, but you   can.","""Suspicions"""
144,BEVERLY ,"   At the time, I was too preoccupied   with my problems to understand   what he was saying. I wasn't   thinking about the rest of my   life... I was trying to make sense   of what had happened...","""Suspicions"""
145,REYGA,       Run another diagnostic on the EPS   flow regulator.,"""Suspicions"""
146,DATA,   The flow regulator is functioning   properly.,"""Suspicions"""
147,REYGA,   What about the field emitter coil?   Has it maintained polarity?,"""Suspicions"""
148,DATA,"       Yes, Doctor.","""Suspicions"""
149,REYGA,   The radial force compensator?,"""Suspicions"""
150,DATA,   I am unable to locate any   malfunction. All of your systems   are operating according to your   design specifications.,"""Suspicions"""
151,BEVERLY,   You didn't find anything wrong?,"""Suspicions"""
152,REYGA,   I don't understand it. There must   be something we've overlooked...,"""Suspicions"""
153,GEORDI,   I found some micro-crystalline   damage to the hull which confirms   that your shield was breached by   a burst of baryonic radiation...,"""Suspicions"""
154,BEVERLY,   Were the levels high enough to   damage organic tissue?,"""Suspicions"""
155,GEORDI,   I don't know.,"""Suspicions"""
156,DATA,       Perhaps there was an unexpected   interaction between the solar   radiation and your metaphasic   shield.,"""Suspicions"""
157,REYGA,"   No, that's not possible... I   anticipated every contingency.","""Suspicions"""
158,GEORDI,   Then Jo'Bril must've run into   something in the corona which you   didn't anticipate... and your   shield just wasn't able to protect   him from it.,"""Suspicions"""
159,BEVERLY ,   Reyga was angry... but I knew it   was because he was so   disappointed. Everything he'd   worked for... hoped for... was   slipping away...,"""Suspicions"""
160,BEVERLY ,   ... and that made what I had to do   next even harder.,"""Suspicions"""
161,BEVERLY,   I'm sure you can all understand   that in light of what's   happened... it would be   inappropriate to continue with the   project.,"""Suspicions"""
162,BEVERLY,"   Perhaps when Doctor Reyga has   perfected his metaphasic   technology, we can try again.","""Suspicions"""
163,REYGA,   Doctor Crusher... please... if I   could have a little more time to   investigate... I'm sure I could   find what went wrong.,"""Suspicions"""
164,CHRISTOPHER,"   But that won't bring back Jo'Bril,   will it?","""Suspicions"""
165,T'PAN,   I do not believe the shield will   ever work. Its very concept is   flawed.,"""Suspicions"""
166,REYGA,   Just one more test...,"""Suspicions"""
167,KURAK,   Whom do you propose to sacrifice   next?,"""Suspicions"""
168,REYGA,   I will pilot the shuttle myself.,"""Suspicions"""
169,BEVERLY,"   I'm sorry. But as Chief Medical   Officer, I'm responsible for the   health and safety of the people   aboard.       And I will not authorize any   further tests.","""Suspicions"""
170,REYGA,   Very well.       But I will prove myself.,"""Suspicions"""
171,BEVERLY ,   I couldn't help but admire his   tenacity. He just wasn't going to   accept defeat. And I hoped he   would prove himself.       But that was the last time I saw   him alive.,"""Suspicions"""
172,BEVERLY ,   We'd gone to Science Lab Four when   the ship's sensors registered a   sizeable plasma surge there...,"""Suspicions"""
173,BEVERLY,   A plasma infuser... it's been   completely discharged. The blast   must have killed him instantly.,"""Suspicions"""
174,WORF,"   Perhaps he could not live with the   failure of his invention, and took   his own life.","""Suspicions"""
175,BEVERLY,   Or perhaps someone just wants it   to look that way.    (indicating plasma     infuser)   Look at this... isn't it odd that   he could hold on so tightly to the   infuser when it was discharged.   The normal reflex would be to drop   it.,"""Suspicions"""
176,WORF,   The plasma shock could have   affected his nervous system. He   may have reacted by gripping   tighter.,"""Suspicions"""
177,BEVERLY,   I'll know for certain when I do   the autopsy.,"""Suspicions"""
178,WORF,"   Is your examination complete,   Doctor?","""Suspicions"""
179,BEVERLY,   For now. You can transfer the   body to the Morgue.,"""Suspicions"""
180,WORF,   Very well.,"""Suspicions"""
181,BEVERLY ,   I remembered his passion... and   commitment... and his   determination to prove himself.   And I was sure that this man had   not taken his own life.,"""Suspicions"""
182,BEVERLY,"   Jean-Luc, I was with him right   before he died. He was not   suicidal.","""Suspicions"""
183,PICARD,"   I respect your instincts, of   course... but by your own   admission, Reyga was not an easy   man to understand. Isn't it   possible that he was simply   masking his feelings?","""Suspicions"""
184,BEVERLY,   I don't think so. He was   disappointed at the failure of his   device... and upset by Jo'Bril's   death... but there was no sense   that he was ready to take his own   life.,"""Suspicions"""
185,PICARD,   I'm sure it's difficult for you to   accept. You championed him... you   believed in his invention...,"""Suspicions"""
186,BEVERLY,"   This isn't about my feelings --   I'm saying that Reyga didn't kill   himself... and if that's true,   someone else did it.","""Suspicions"""
187,PICARD,   Beverly... I know what you're   going through. I know what it's   like to feel -- responsible for a   tragedy. I know the temptation to   look for anything that would   remove some of that culpability...,"""Suspicions"""
188,BEVERLY,"       I know I can't expect you to   accept what I'm saying without   evidence. When I've finished the   autopsy, I hope I'll have it.","""Suspicions"""
189,PICARD,   I'm afraid there won't be an   autopsy.,"""Suspicions"""
190,PICARD,   The family has already been   contacted... they insist the body   must not be touched before they   perform the Ferengi death rituals.,"""Suspicions"""
191,BEVERLY,   But... there's a question about   the circumstances of his death --,"""Suspicions"""
192,PICARD,"   To the family, that is irrelevant.","""Suspicions"""
193,BEVERLY,   Maybe if I talked to them...,"""Suspicions"""
194,PICARD,   I promise you -- they are adamant.   We're scheduled to rendezvous with   a Ferengi ship in seventeen hours.   They will be picking up Reyga's   body then.       I'm sorry. But there will be no   autopsy.,"""Suspicions"""
195,BEVERLY,   I can't just let it drop... don't   you see -- ? There might have   been a murder.,"""Suspicions"""
196,PICARD,   If you can find evidence of   that... in some way other than an   autopsy... I'll consider it.,"""Suspicions"""
197,OGAWA,"   I don't understand, Doctor. Isn't   it pretty clear that Reyga died   from a plasma discharge?","""Suspicions"""
198,BEVERLY,"   It's not clear without an autopsy.   For all I know, he might have been   poisoned... and the plasma infuser   put in his hand after he died.","""Suspicions"""
199,OGAWA,   You think he was murdered?,"""Suspicions"""
200,BEVERLY,"   I'm not discounting that   possibility. The point is,   without a complete autopsy,   there's no way to know for   certain.","""Suspicions"""
201,OGAWA,   Why won't the Ferengi allow it?,"""Suspicions"""
