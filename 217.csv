17,SOREN,   What happened? Where did it go?,"""The Outcast"""
18,PICARD ,"   Captain's log, supplemental. The   sudden disappearance of our probe   suggests that we may have found   the first instance of what is   called null space -- an anomaly   which until now had been only   theoretical. Commander Riker has   been working around the clock with   a team of J'naii specialists to   formalize this hypothesis.","""The Outcast"""

24,RIKER,   Or a probe. Making them   powerless.,"""The Outcast"""
25,SOREN,"   But outside the pocket, all energy   is bent around it -- making it   naturally cloaked. That's why   we can't see it, and sensors don't   read it.","""The Outcast"""
26,NOOR,   Is the shuttle still there?,"""The Outcast"""
27,RIKER,   We think so. The ship probably   couldn't sustain its power...   but other than that it wouldn't   be damaged.,"""The Outcast"""
28,SOREN,"   Since our shuttles carry   plestorene-based backup systems,   we think life support would   sustain for as long as ten days.","""The Outcast"""
29,NOOR,   Then perhaps our crew has   survived...,"""The Outcast"""
30,RIKER,   We can send one of our shuttles   into the null space -- but its   energy output would be absorbed   as well. Our chief engineer is   working on a way to maintain the   power reserves long enough to   rescue your crew.,"""The Outcast"""

48,RIKER,   That's where the emitters come   in. We'll shoot a series of   photon pulses into the pocket and   chart the points where they   disappear. We should be able to   plot a fairly complete outline   that way.,"""The Outcast"""

80,SOREN,   That makes it sound better to be   female.,"""The Outcast"""
81,RIKER,"   It's an old fashioned way of   looking at the sexes. Not to say   that there aren't real   differences. Physically, men tend   to be bigger... stronger in the   upper body. We have different   sexual organs. Men don't bear   young...","""The Outcast"""
82,SOREN,   What about... feelings? Emotional   attitudes? Are they different?,"""The Outcast"""
83,RIKER,   Well... most people think so.   But that's the kind of question   that might take an hour or two   to answer.,"""The Outcast"""
84,RIKER,   Let me ask you...       What's it like... on a planet where   the people have no gender?,"""The Outcast"""

94,SOREN,   And is that the kind of woman all   human males prefer?,"""The Outcast"""

96,SOREN,   You make it sound very complex.,"""The Outcast"""
97,RIKER,   Believe me -- it is.,"""The Outcast"""
