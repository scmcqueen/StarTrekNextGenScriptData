413,DATA,"   Captain, your leeway has run out.","""Devil's Due"""
414,PICARD,"   Your honor, I appreciate the   court's indulgence... allow me   to explain. A team from the   Enterprise has taken control of   this woman's ship in orbit around   Ventax Two. Thank you for your   help, Number One.","""Devil's Due"""
415,RIKER,"   Glad to be of service, sir.","""Devil's Due"""
416,PICARD,"   They have been monitoring me on   my communicator... and executing   a prearranged program on her   ship's computer... a fairly   ingenious combination of force   field projection, holography, and   transporter effects. Ardra   controls her magic literally by   the blink of an eye... centuries   old technology -- an implant that   allows her eye movements to choose   and activate each illusion.       She once told us she is known by   many names. At least she was   honest about that. Her crew has   admitted that she has in fact   used twenty-three aliases in this   sector alone...","""Devil's Due"""

419,PICARD,"   Ventax Two offered her the   greatest opportunity of her   nefarious career. She learned   about the myth of Ardra, studied   it... and expertly played on your   fears until your people were ready   to virtually surrender to her.","""Devil's Due"""
420,ARDRA,"       Your Honor, under the   circumstances, I believe it is   only fair that I release the   Ventaxians from their   obligation... and I'll even let   them keep the peace they have...   and I'll just be on my way...","""Devil's Due"""
