254,DATA,"   They are genetic codes which are   normally dormant. They are   evolutionary holdovers --   sequences of DNA that provided key   physical and behavioral   characteristics millions of years   ago, but are no longer necessary.       For instance, Counselor Troi's   gill slits and other amphibious   characteristics were derived from   introns which still contain   amphibious codes.","""Genesis"""

257,PICARD,   Commander Riker's introns are   changing him into one of the   earlier hominids...,"""Genesis"""
258,DATA,"   Yes, sir. I would say...   Australopithacine.       Each of these stages is another   link in the evolutionary chain,   stretching back to the origins of   all lifeforms on Earth.       Because introns can include   genetic material from many   different species over millions of   years of evolution, it is possible   that a wide variety of   transformations is occurring among   the crew.","""Genesis"""
