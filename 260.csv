0,PICARD ,   Captain's Log: Stardate 47304.2.   The Enterprise has arrived at   Kesprytt Three in order to   evaluate an unusual request on the   part of the Kes for associate   membership in the Federation.,"""Attached"""
1,BEVERLY,"   She's been very secretive... every   time I ask her about it or try to   edge around the subject, she   changes the subject. Personally,   I think she's in love.","""Attached"""
2,PICARD,   Mmmmm.,"""Attached"""
3,BEVERLY,"   Didn't you hear me? I said, she's   in love.","""Attached"""
4,PICARD,   Yes?,"""Attached"""
5,BEVERLY,   Is that all you can say?,"""Attached"""
6,PICARD,   What would you like me to say?   I'm very pleased for them both.,"""Attached"""
7,BEVERLY,   Both of who?,"""Attached"""
8,PICARD,   The two... people we were   discussing.,"""Attached"""
9,BEVERLY,"       You don't have the slightest idea   who I'm talking about, do you?","""Attached"""
10,PICARD,"       No... no, I'm sorry... but I   really don't.","""Attached"""
11,BEVERLY,       I'll try not to take that   personally... I've been talking   about Nurse Ogawa and Ensign   Markson for almost fifteen   minutes.,"""Attached"""
12,PICARD,"   Oh, now it hasn't been that long.","""Attached"""
13,BEVERLY,   How would you know? You haven't   heard a thing I've said since I   got here.,"""Attached"""
14,PICARD,   You're right. I'm sorry.,"""Attached"""
15,BEVERLY,   Are you worried about this mission   with the Kes?,"""Attached"""
16,PICARD,   Not worried exactly... just   uneasy. This notion of admitting   half of their planet to the   Federation while leaving the other   half out...,"""Attached"""
17,BEVERLY,"   Well, first of all, the Kes are   not half the planet, they're   almost three-quarters of it. And   the Prytt are not being left out --   they simply don't want any outside   contact with the Federation or   anyone else.","""Attached"""
18,PICARD,   Every member of the Federation has   entered as a unified world... and   that unity said something about   them... that they had resolved   certain social and political   problems at home and were ready to   join a larger community.,"""Attached"""
19,BEVERLY,"   From all indications, the Kes are   a very unified, very progressive   people.","""Attached"""
20,PICARD,   But the Prytt are not. They are   reclusive to the point of   xenophobia.,"""Attached"""
21,BEVERLY,"   Think about Earth -- what if one   of the old nation-states, say   Australia, had decided not to join   the World Government in twenty-one   fifty? Would that have   disqualified us from being a   Federation member?","""Attached"""
22,PICARD,   That analogy is not entirely --,"""Attached"""
23,RIKER,   Riker to Captain.,"""Attached"""
24,PICARD,"       Go ahead, Number One.","""Attached"""
25,RIKER,   We've received word from   Ambassador Mauric that he's ready   to see you and Doctor Crusher.,"""Attached"""
26,PICARD,   Inform him we're on our way.,"""Attached"""
27,RIKER,   Acknowledged.,"""Attached"""
28,PICARD,   Thank you for breakfast.,"""Attached"""
29,BEVERLY,   Wait until tomorrow... I have   something very special planned.   It's a Vulcan dish -- that's all   I'll tell you.,"""Attached"""
30,WORF,   Captain. Doctor. I have the   coordinates of Ambassador Mauric's   chambers.,"""Attached"""
31,PICARD,"   Let's not keep them waiting,   Mister Worf.","""Attached"""
32,WORF,       Enterprise to Kes Security Relay   Station One. We're ready to   commence transport.,"""Attached"""
33,KES COM,"   Acknowledged, Enterprise. We have   lowered our defense shield.","""Attached"""
34,WORF,   Confirmed.,"""Attached"""
35,PICARD,   Energize.,"""Attached"""
36,KES COM,   This is Security Relay Station   One. We are ready to receive your   Captain and Medical Officer.,"""Attached"""
37,WORF,       This is the Enterprise. We have   completed the transport sequence.   You should have them.,"""Attached"""
38,KES COM,"   Negative, Enterprise. They are   not here.","""Attached"""
39,PICARD,   Beverly... Beverly...,"""Attached"""
40,BEVERLY,   What happened?,"""Attached"""
41,PICARD,   I don't know.,"""Attached"""
42,BEVERLY,   The last thing I remember... was   beginning the transport...,"""Attached"""
43,PICARD,   I would assume that we're on   Kesprytt... in some kind of   prison cell.,"""Attached"""
44,PICARD,       The question is why? I can't   imagine that Ambassador Mauric   would --,"""Attached"""
45,BEVERLY,   Jean-Luc.,"""Attached"""
46,PICARD,   What is it?,"""Attached"""
47,BEVERLY,   I'm not sure.,"""Attached"""
48,BEVERLY,   It's an implant... looks like it   might be connected directly to the   brainstem.,"""Attached"""
49,PICARD,   Some kind of coercive device... ?,"""Attached"""
50,BEVERLY,       Whatever they are... I doubt   they're designed for our health.,"""Attached"""
51,PICARD,   Why are we being held?,"""Attached"""
52,BEVERLY,"   If you tell us why you've taken us   hostage, we might be able to --","""Attached"""
53,LORIN,   You are not hostages. You are   prisoners.,"""Attached"""
54,PICARD,   Prisoners. By whose authority?,"""Attached"""
55,LORIN,   You are being held under the   authority of the Prytt Security   Ministry. The charge is   conspiring with the enemy.,"""Attached"""
56,PICARD,   The enemy... you mean the Kes.,"""Attached"""
57,LORIN,   We are not fools. We are aware of   the Federation attempt to   establish a military alliance with   the Kes. It will not be   tolerated.,"""Attached"""
58,PICARD,   Your information is in error.   There are no plans to enter into   any --,"""Attached"""
59,LORIN,"   There is no point in trying to   mislead us, Captain. The devices   which have been implanted in your   cerebral cortexes will soon be   calibrated to your psi-wave   patterns. At that time, we will   get all the information we need.","""Attached"""
60,PICARD,   And you will discover that we're   telling the truth.,"""Attached"""
61,LORIN,   We shall see.,"""Attached"""
62,DATA,   There is nothing wrong with the   Transporter. I have run a   complete diagnostic and checked   all the targeting components.,"""Attached"""
63,RIKER,   Then what happened to the Captain   and Doctor Crusher?,"""Attached"""
64,WORF,   Commander. The Transporter sensor   log shows an unusual concentration   of antigraviton particles in the   emitter coil. These particles do   not occur naturally -- something   must have interfered with the   Transporter.,"""Attached"""
65,RIKER,   Interfered?,"""Attached"""
66,DATA,   A concentration of antigraviton   particles would suggest a tractor   beam. It might have deflected the   Transporter beam to a different   set of coordinates.,"""Attached"""
67,RIKER,   Is there a way to locate those   coordinates?,"""Attached"""
68,DATA,"   No, sir.       However, it may be possible to   determine the point of origin of   the tractor beam itself.","""Attached"""
69,RIKER,"   Well, that's a start.","""Attached"""
70,DATA,   The tractor beam originated from   somewhere within the Prytt   Alliance.,"""Attached"""
71,RIKER,   The Prytt... things just got a   little more complicated.       Can we scan for them?,"""Attached"""
72,DATA,       Prytt territory is shielded by a   high-energy forcefield. It cannot   be penetrated by our sensors.,"""Attached"""
73,WORF,   Why would the Prytt want Captain   Picard and Doctor Crusher?,"""Attached"""
74,RIKER,   I don't know. And it's not going   to be easy to find out... the   Prytt have consistently refused   all outside contact and somehow I   don't think they're going to be   eager to start now. We'll have to   work through the Kes.       Contact Ambassador Mauric and tell   him we need a meeting right away.,"""Attached"""
75,WORF,"   Aye, sir.","""Attached"""
76,PICARD,   What?,"""Attached"""
77,BEVERLY,       What?,"""Attached"""
78,PICARD,   You're staring at me.,"""Attached"""
79,BEVERLY,   Sorry. I was just wondering how   long you were going to keep at   this.,"""Attached"""
80,PICARD,"       As long as it takes. With any   luck, there may be a structural   flaw that would allow us to   escape.","""Attached"""
81,BEVERLY,       Right.,"""Attached"""
82,PICARD,   The important thing during any   confinement is to think positively   and not to give up hope... there   is a way out of every box... there   is a solution to every puzzle...   it is simply a matter of --,"""Attached"""
83,PICARD,   Damn.,"""Attached"""
84,BEVERLY,"   Well, at least this means we're   not going to starve to death.","""Attached"""
85,PICARD,       What it means is that they plan on   keeping us here for a while...,"""Attached"""
86,BEVERLY,"   I'm starting to think negatively,   Jean-Luc.","""Attached"""
87,BEVERLY,   My tricorder!,"""Attached"""
88,PICARD,   Does it work?,"""Attached"""
89,BEVERLY,       Yes. But something's been added   to the main directory.,"""Attached"""
90,PICARD,   It's a map...,"""Attached"""
91,BEVERLY,   An escape route. That guard must   be working for the Kes...,"""Attached"""
92,PICARD,   Possibly.,"""Attached"""
93,BEVERLY,   What else could it be?,"""Attached"""
94,PICARD,   It could be part of a very   carefully laid trap.,"""Attached"""
95,BEVERLY,"   If you ask me, I'd rather take my   chances out there.","""Attached"""
96,PICARD,   Agreed. Is there a way to open   the cell door?,"""Attached"""
97,BEVERLY,   Yes. The code's been entered.,"""Attached"""
98,MAURIC,"   On behalf of my government, I   would like to take this   opportunity to present our   profound apologizes to you   regarding this unfortunate   incident.","""Attached"""
99,RIKER,"   That's very kind, Ambassador. But   I don't think anyone here blames   you or the Kes government for   what's happened.","""Attached"""
100,TROI,"   Our primary concern is not to   assign blame, but to recover our   missing officers.","""Attached"""
101,MAURIC,   Of course.       We are prepared to insert a   hostage rescue team into the Prytt   capital city on three hours   notice.,"""Attached"""
102,RIKER,   Ambassador... we haven't even   tried a diplomatic effort yet.   I'd rather not use force until   we've exhausted all other options.,"""Attached"""
103,MAURIC,"   I don't believe we have any...   diplomatic options, Commander.   There are no formal relations with   the Prytt...     ","""Attached"""
104,,,"""Attached"""
105,MAURIC ,   ... no ambassadors... there's   simply no way to contact them.,"""Attached"""
106,TROI,   Surely you must have some means of   communication in case of a   planetary emergency.,"""Attached"""
107,MAURIC,   We have never had need of such a   system.,"""Attached"""
108,WORF,   We can determine their   communications frequencies and   establish a link.,"""Attached"""
109,MAURIC,"   Allow me to be blunt.       The Prytt are a fanatical,   xenophobic people, with little   regard for civilized discourse.   Even if you do establish a   communications link with them, it   will be a complete waste of time.","""Attached"""
110,TROI,   How long has it been since your   last diplomatic contact?,"""Attached"""
111,MAURIC,   Almost a century.,"""Attached"""
112,TROI,   Then it's possible that they've   changed over the years.,"""Attached"""
113,MAURIC,"       We have had other... less formal   contacts with the Prytt --   contacts that I cannot discuss.   But I can assure you, they have   changed very little.","""Attached"""
114,RIKER,"   Mister Ambassador... with all due   respect, I feel I should make an   attempt to communicate with the   Prytt before I sanction the use of   force.","""Attached"""
115,MAURIC,"   Of course, Commander. In the   meantime, I will continue to make   preparations for a rescue attempt.","""Attached"""
116,RIKER,   Agreed.,"""Attached"""
117,MAURIC,"   I do have one request. We believe   that the Prytt obtained their   information about the transport of   your captain and doctor through a   breach in our communications   network. If I could set up a base   of operations here on the   Enterprise, I would feel much more   secure.","""Attached"""
118,RIKER,       Mister Worf will help you.,"""Attached"""
119,MAURIC,   Thank you.,"""Attached"""
120,MAURIC,   You first.,"""Attached"""
121,WORF,"   Is there a problem, Ambassador?","""Attached"""
122,MAURIC,   Probably not. I am simply   securing the area.,"""Attached"""
123,WORF,   I can assure you there is no need.,"""Attached"""
124,MAURIC,"   I'm sure you're right.    (beat, as he checks one     last area)   This will do nicely.","""Attached"""
125,WORF,"   As Security Chief of the   Enterprise, I would be glad to   assist you in any way possible --","""Attached"""
126,MAURIC,"   There's no need. We'll take care   of everything.       Thank you, Lieutenant.","""Attached"""
127,WORF,"   Is there a problem, Ambassador?","""Attached"""
128,MAURIC,   Probably not. I am simply   securing the area.,"""Attached"""
129,WORF,   I can assure you there is no need.,"""Attached"""
130,MAURIC,"   I'm sure you're right.    (beat, as he checks one     last area)   Well. This will do nicely.","""Attached"""
131,WORF,"   As Security Chief of the   Enterprise, I would be glad to   assist you in any way possible --","""Attached"""
132,MAURIC,"   There's no need. We'll take care   of everything.       Thank you, Lieutenant.","""Attached"""
133,PICARD,       Someone obviously put a lot of   time and effort into this.,"""Attached"""
134,BEVERLY,   It might have been the guard's   personal escape route.,"""Attached"""
135,PICARD,   You're assuming he's a Kes agent.,"""Attached"""
136,BEVERLY,   Seems logical.,"""Attached"""
137,PICARD,   There must be a lava flow or a hot   spring somewhere near by.,"""Attached"""
138,BEVERLY,       It's a lava flow... about thirty   meters beneath us.       We're supposed to head this way.,"""Attached"""
139,BEVERLY,       I smell gas...,"""Attached"""
140,BEVERLY,       This whole chamber is filled with   pockets of a methanogenic   compound...,"""Attached"""
141,PICARD,   Can we get through it?,"""Attached"""
142,BEVERLY,   I think so...,"""Attached"""
143,PICARD,   What did you say?,"""Attached"""
144,BEVERLY,   I didn't say anything.       There seems to be a fairly regular   pattern to these eruptions... if   we're careful we should be able to   navigate through them.,"""Attached"""
145,PICARD,   Say when...,"""Attached"""
146,BEVERLY,   Now...,"""Attached"""
147,PICARD,   The eruptions have stopped...,"""Attached"""
148,BEVERLY,       The gas is building up!,"""Attached"""
149,DATA,   I have scanned the entire Prytt   communications system and I   believe this is the primary access   module for the central government.,"""Attached"""
150,RIKER,   Can you determine which of these   com links is connected to their   prime minister's office?,"""Attached"""
151,DATA,"   I believe so. However, the Prytt   have no link designed for extraterritorial   communications. Our   hail may come as a surprise to   them.","""Attached"""
152,RIKER,"   Well, they're going to have to   adjust. Open a channel.","""Attached"""
153,PRYTT COM,   This is Prime Minister Horath's   headquarters. How can I be of   service?,"""Attached"""
154,RIKER,   This is Commander William T.   Riker of the Federation starship   Enterprise. I know this is an   unusual way to --,"""Attached"""
155,PRYTT COM,       The Enterprise? You mean the ship   in orbit?,"""Attached"""
156,RIKER,   That's right.,"""Attached"""
157,PRYTT COM,   Why are you on this com-link?,"""Attached"""
158,RIKER,"   Well, we didn't know how to   contact your government directly,   so we had to start somewhere. Now   if I could talk with your--","""Attached"""
159,PRYTT COM,   Did you get authorization for this   communication from the Security   Ministry?,"""Attached"""
160,RIKER,"   No. As I said, we didn't know how   to contact you so--","""Attached"""
161,PRYTT COM,   I cannot participate in an   unauthorized communication.,"""Attached"""
162,RIKER,   Not very friendly are they?,"""Attached"""
163,DATA,"   No, sir.","""Attached"""
164,WORF,   Sir. We are being hailed... it is   the Prytt Security Council.,"""Attached"""
165,RIKER,   Looks like we got somebody's   attention. On screen.,"""Attached"""
166,LORIN,"   Enterprise, this is Security   Minister Lorin. You will   immediately cease all attempts at   communication with our people.","""Attached"""
167,RIKER,"   Minister, we've been trying to   contact someone in your   government. It appears that   you've detained two of our   officers and we would like to   discuss this situation.","""Attached"""
168,LORIN,"   There is nothing to discuss. If   you do not terminate these   transmissions, we will be forced   to take aggressive action against   your ship.","""Attached"""
169,WORF,   Their weapon systems pose no   threat to the Enterprise.,"""Attached"""
170,RIKER,"   Just the same, let's keep the   shields up for the time being.","""Attached"""
171,WORF,"   Aye, sir.","""Attached"""
172,MAURIC,"       Is there a problem, Commander?","""Attached"""
173,RIKER,   Our efforts with the Prytt just   ran into a wall.,"""Attached"""
174,MAURIC,   I am sorry. But perhaps this will   brighten your spirits -- we have   freed your Captain and doctor.,"""Attached"""
175,RIKER,       What?,"""Attached"""
176,MAURIC,   They were being held in a prison   just outside the Prytt capital.   One of our operatives was able to   arrange their escape.,"""Attached"""
177,WORF,   Where are they now?,"""Attached"""
178,MAURIC,   They should be en route to the Kes   border. Our operative provided   them with a detailed map and   instructions on where to go.,"""Attached"""
179,RIKER,   How do you plan to get them across   the border?,"""Attached"""
180,MAURIC,"   At the moment, that information is   confidential. But trust us... we   do have a plan.","""Attached"""
181,RIKER,   Ambassador... I'm afraid I must   insist that you provide us with   more information.,"""Attached"""
182,MAURIC,"   I understand your concern, of   course. But I would feel more...   comfortable discussing operational   details in a... less public   environment.","""Attached"""
183,RIKER,   Certainly. We can step into the   Ready Room.,"""Attached"""
184,MAURIC,   I would prefer... the quarters you   provided me. They're safer.,"""Attached"""
185,RIKER,   All right.,"""Attached"""
186,PICARD,   There's no way out of here...,"""Attached"""
187,BEVERLY,   Maybe we took a wrong turn...,"""Attached"""
188,BEVERLY,       Me too...,"""Attached"""
189,PICARD,       What?,"""Attached"""
190,BEVERLY,   I'm thirsty too.,"""Attached"""
191,PICARD,   I didn't say anything about being   thirsty.,"""Attached"""
192,BEVERLY,"   I heard you. You said, ""I'm very   thirsty.""","""Attached"""
193,PICARD,"   I was thinking about it, but I   didn't say anything.","""Attached"""
194,BEVERLY,   You were thinking it...,"""Attached"""
195,PICARD,       The transceivers. Lorin said they   would align themselves to our psi   wave patterns...,"""Attached"""
196,BEVERLY,   The implants might be transmitting   our thoughts.       What am I thinking?,"""Attached"""
197,PICARD,   I don't know.,"""Attached"""
198,BEVERLY,"   I can't hear your thoughts,   either. Maybe it was just a   fluke.","""Attached"""
199,PICARD,"       For now, I'm afraid we have more   immediate concerns. Does the map   indicate a way out of here?","""Attached"""
200,BEVERLY,   Yes. We go up.,"""Attached"""
201,BEVERLY,       There's a ledge about thirty   meters up that connects to another   tunnel which should lead to the   surface.,"""Attached"""
202,PICARD,   Right.,"""Attached"""
203,PICARD,       I heard that.       They weren't words exactly... I   suddenly had this... sense of   fear... a fear of heights.,"""Attached"""
204,BEVERLY,   So much for it being a fluke.,"""Attached"""
205,PICARD,   What a strange sensation... your   thoughts just appeared in my mind.,"""Attached"""
206,BEVERLY,"   If you sensed fear of heights, you   sensed pretty accurately.","""Attached"""
207,PICARD,"   Come on. We've done this   before... it's just like on the   Holodeck.    (takes her hand and puts     it on rock)   One hand-hold at a time... nothing   too fast... just a slow, gentle   climb.","""Attached"""
208,BEVERLY,       Right.,"""Attached"""
209,RIKER,   I see you've done some   redecorating.,"""Attached"""
210,MAURIC,   Just a few pieces of equipment we   needed for security reasons. You   understand.,"""Attached"""
211,RIKER,   Certainly.,"""Attached"""
212,AIDE,   He is all right.,"""Attached"""
213,RIKER,   Ambassador... how do you plan to   get my people out of Prytt   territory?,"""Attached"""
214,MAURIC,"   You must realize that what I am   about to tell you cannot leave   this room.       For some time now, we have had   certain... friends among the   Prytt. Citizens who have realized   that the long struggle between our   two peoples can only end when the   Prytt government is made to see   reason.","""Attached"""
215,RIKER,   You've recruited a few Prytt   spies.,"""Attached"""
216,MAURIC,"   A crude, but accurate term. These   friends will be waiting for your   Captain and Doctor when they reach   the village of Ohn-Kor near the   Kes border. The map we provided   your officers will take them to a   tavern there.","""Attached"""
217,RIKER,"   Forgive me, Ambassador, but is it   wise to send two human fugitives   in Starfleet uniforms into a Prytt   village?","""Attached"""
218,MAURIC,   The danger is minimal. Our   operatives control most of the   town.,"""Attached"""
219,MAURIC,"       Once they have made contact with   Captain Picard and Doctor Crusher,   our friends will escort them   across the Kes border.","""Attached"""
220,RIKER,   I'd still feel better if they   could rendezvous with your   operatives in a less public place.,"""Attached"""
221,MAURIC,"   Commander, I assure you we know   what we're doing. We have a great   deal of experience in dealing with   the Prytt. And we would hardly   risk the safety of your people...   after all -- we're still hoping   you'll recommend our entrance into   the Federation.","""Attached"""
222,PICARD,   One of us is hungry.,"""Attached"""
223,BEVERLY,   That would be me.,"""Attached"""
224,PICARD,   Try to think of something else.   You're making me hungry.,"""Attached"""
225,BEVERLY,   What would you like me to think   about?,"""Attached"""
226,PICARD,   Something other than a large bowl   of vegetable soup.,"""Attached"""
227,BEVERLY,       My grandmother used to make it...   with beans and peas and carrots --,"""Attached"""
228,PICARD,   Beverly.,"""Attached"""
229,BEVERLY,   Sorry.,"""Attached"""
230,PICARD,       I am not being unreasonable.,"""Attached"""
231,BEVERLY,"   I didn't say you were. I may have   thought it, but there's a   difference.","""Attached"""
232,PICARD,   You're right. We can't react to   every random thought that crosses   the other person's mind.       It's astonishing how much...   clutter there is in our   consciousness. Odd memories   coming to the surface... bits of   half-remembered songs...,"""Attached"""
233,BEVERLY,       Stray day-dreams... scattered   minutiae... I wonder how true   telepaths sift through it all.   How can they get to what someone's   really thinking if their minds are   constantly churning all this   flotsam to the surface?,"""Attached"""
234,BEVERLY,   That is not funny.,"""Attached"""
235,PICARD,       I just wanted to see if you were   listening.,"""Attached"""
236,BEVERLY,   I think the link is getting   stronger.,"""Attached"""
237,PICARD,       Maybe we should put some distance   between us... that might weaken   it.       Not that I'm tired of hearing your   most intimate thoughts...,"""Attached"""
238,BEVERLY,   Certainly not.,"""Attached"""
239,BEVERLY,   Jean-Luc...,"""Attached"""
240,PICARD,   What happened?,"""Attached"""
241,BEVERLY,   I don't know... I suddenly felt a   wave of nausea.,"""Attached"""
242,PICARD,   Me too.,"""Attached"""
243,BEVERLY,       I don't see anything wrong with   either of us.       Maybe the air is toxic...,"""Attached"""
244,PICARD,   The same thing... but when you   moved back toward me... I felt   better.,"""Attached"""
245,PICARD,   It would seem we're stuck with   each other.,"""Attached"""
246,PICARD,   What's wrong?,"""Attached"""
247,BEVERLY,   I can't tell if we're supposed to   go over this hill... or that one.   The topography on this map is a   little vague.,"""Attached"""
248,PICARD,   Let me see.,"""Attached"""
249,PICARD,"    (continuing,     confidently)   This way.","""Attached"""
250,BEVERLY,"   You don't really know, do you?","""Attached"""
251,PICARD,   What?,"""Attached"""
252,BEVERLY,   You're acting like you know   exactly which way to go... but   you're just guessing. Do you do   this all the time?,"""Attached"""
253,PICARD,   No.     ,"""Attached"""
254,,,"""Attached"""
255,PICARD ,       But... there are times when it's   important for a Captain to give   the appearance of confidence.,"""Attached"""
256,BEVERLY,   I'm sorry... I'm sorry. I   couldn't resist...,"""Attached"""
257,PICARD,   I'm beginning to realize that you   seem to always have some...   acerbic remark on the tip of your   tongue.,"""Attached"""
258,BEVERLY,"   At least I've trained myself not   to say it anymore. When I was a   little girl, my mouth was always   landing me in trouble with my   parents... my teachers...","""Attached"""
259,PICARD,       Your friends... and someone named   Tom Norris... ?,"""Attached"""
260,BEVERLY,"       That's right. We had one date...   which I brought to an abrupt halt   with the words... ""Is that a beard   or is your face dirty?""","""Attached"""
261,PICARD,"       ""Or is your face dirty?""","""Attached"""
262,PICARD,"   There's something more... you're   laughing, but...       You actually feel... embarrassed   about that incident.","""Attached"""
263,BEVERLY,       Yes.       I thought I was being cute... but   I really hurt him.,"""Attached"""
264,BEVERLY,       That was a long time ago. And it   taught me a valuable lesson.,"""Attached"""
265,PICARD,       This... sharing of thoughts and   feelings... it's compelling in a   strange way...,"""Attached"""
266,BEVERLY,   Very.       We'd better get going.,"""Attached"""
267,BEVERLY,"       I don't think so, either. Maybe   there's another way to reach the   village.","""Attached"""
268,PICARD,   No. We'd have to backtrack   several kilometers to find another   way over this ridge.,"""Attached"""
269,PICARD,"       The border's only two kilometers   east of here... there's a   forcefield protecting it, but   we'll have to find a way to deal   with that when we get there.","""Attached"""
270,AIDE,       All right.,"""Attached"""
271,RIKER,       Is something wrong?,"""Attached"""
272,MAURIC,   Have a seat.,"""Attached"""
273,MAURIC,       Captain Picard and Doctor Crusher   did not show up at the designated   rendezvous point.,"""Attached"""
274,RIKER,   Do you know what happened to them?,"""Attached"""
275,MAURIC,   No. We have no idea what happened   to them.       We find it strange that your   officers would follow the escape   plan so precisely -- but then fail   to make a crucial rendezvous with   our operatives.,"""Attached"""
276,WORF,   It is possible they have been   recaptured.,"""Attached"""
277,MAURIC,"       Our sources would have informed us   instantly if that had happened.       But of course, if they weren't   captured... if they simply... made   a different rendezvous... we might   not ever know about it.","""Attached"""
278,RIKER,   A different rendezvous? I'm not   sure what you mean.,"""Attached"""
279,MAURIC,       Of course you're not. You   wouldn't know if your Captain and   Doctor were meeting secretly with   the Prytt.       Meeting in order to set up a   military alliance with the   Federation...,"""Attached"""
280,RIKER,   What?,"""Attached"""
281,MAURIC,"   It was a clever scheme... first   you pretend to ""lose"" your   officers during transport... then   you ask us for help... and get us   to expose several of our   undercover operatives in the   process. But what you didn't   expect was for us to get your   people out of prison so quickly.   They needed more time... more time   to plot the destruction of the Kes   with their new Prytt friends.","""Attached"""
282,RIKER,"   This is ridiculous. You're   starting to see conspiracies   everywhere. We were invited here   by the Kes, why would we want to   ally ourselves with the Prytt?","""Attached"""
283,MAURIC,   Why indeed?,"""Attached"""
284,RIKER,   You can believe what you want...   we're going to find our people   with or without your help.,"""Attached"""
285,MAURIC,   Then I believe it's time for us to   be leaving the Enterprise.,"""Attached"""
286,RIKER,       Just make sure you take all that   junk with you.,"""Attached"""
287,PICARD,   No luck.,"""Attached"""
288,BEVERLY,   I'm beginning to think there's not   a single thing on this planet we   can eat.,"""Attached"""
289,PICARD,"   Well... if we're lucky, we'll be   back on the Enterprise by this   time tomorrow and you can plant   yourself in front of a replicator   with a knife and fork.","""Attached"""
290,BEVERLY,   Remember that Vulcan dish I   promised you for breakfast? I was   just thinking...,"""Attached"""
291,BEVERLY,       You hate having breakfast with me.,"""Attached"""
292,PICARD,   That's not true.,"""Attached"""
293,BEVERLY,"   Yes, it is. As soon as I said,   ""breakfast"" I heard you say, ""I   hate that.""","""Attached"""
294,PICARD,   That's not quite what I meant...,"""Attached"""
295,BEVERLY,"   Well, what did you mean?","""Attached"""
296,PICARD,   I simply... don't like...,"""Attached"""
297,BEVERLY,       ... don't like what I've been   choosing for breakfast.,"""Attached"""
298,PICARD,"   No, no. It's... just that I feel   breakfast should be... a simple   meal... and recently they seem to   have become more elaborate.","""Attached"""
299,BEVERLY,"       Tea and scones. That's all you   really want, isn't it? Tea and   scones. Why didn't you say so?","""Attached"""
300,PICARD,   It didn't seem that important...,"""Attached"""
301,PICARD,       You don't like those elaborate   meals either.,"""Attached"""
302,BEVERLY,       I usually prefer something simple   myself... but somehow I thought   you might enjoy more variety.,"""Attached"""
303,BEVERLY,"       Well, it's tea and scones for both   of us from now on.","""Attached"""
304,PICARD,       I love firelight.,"""Attached"""
305,BEVERLY,       I love firelight.,"""Attached"""
306,PICARD,   There's something about the   flame... the smell of the   smoke... I've always felt it's   intoxicating in a way...,"""Attached"""
307,BEVERLY,       I remember when Jack and I took   Wesley on his first camping trip   to Balfour Lake. Wesley kept   throwing manta leaves in the fire   to watch them pop... Jack kept   telling him...,"""Attached"""
308,BEVERLY,   What?,"""Attached"""
309,BEVERLY,       Jean-Luc... I heard you. Don't   push it away.,"""Attached"""
310,PICARD,"   Beverly, please. I don't want to   talk about this right now.","""Attached"""
311,BEVERLY,"   When I said, ""Jack and I""... I   could feel this sudden wave of...   something.       I never knew you felt that way.","""Attached"""
312,PICARD,   Didn't you?,"""Attached"""
313,BEVERLY,"   I guess I always knew there was...   an attraction between us, right   from the start. But I had no idea   how strongly you felt...       Why didn't you ever tell me you   were in love with me?","""Attached"""
314,PICARD,"   You were married to my best   friend.       At first, it seemed like a   harmless infatuation... something   more hormonal than emotional. But   then...","""Attached"""
315,BEVERLY,       But then as the months went by...   and the three of us starting   spending more time together...,"""Attached"""
316,PICARD,   I began to realize that it was   something more.       It wasn't right... and I knew I   wouldn't act on it... but I   couldn't help the way I felt.,"""Attached"""
317,BEVERLY,       And when Jack died... you felt   guilty.,"""Attached"""
318,PICARD,"   I felt guilty before he died...   having those kind of feelings for   my best friend's wife. Then...   later, after the accident... I   told myself that no matter what   happened I would never let you   know how I felt.","""Attached"""
319,BEVERLY,   You didn't want to feel as if you   were...,"""Attached"""
320,PICARD,   Betraying my friend...,"""Attached"""
321,BEVERLY,   That's why you didn't want me on   the Enterprise seven years ago.,"""Attached"""
322,PICARD,"   I didn't know how I would react.       But gradually, I found that I   didn't feel that way anymore...   that twenty years was indeed a   long time...","""Attached"""
323,BEVERLY,   And now we're friends...,"""Attached"""
324,PICARD,   Yes... friends.,"""Attached"""
325,BEVERLY,   We still have a lot of ground to   cover tomorrow. We should get   some sleep.,"""Attached"""
326,PICARD,   Right.,"""Attached"""
327,RIKER,   Ambassador. Thank you for coming.,"""Attached"""
328,MAURIC,   Commander.,"""Attached"""
329,RIKER,"   We're about to clear up this   misunderstanding once and for all.       Hail Minister Lorin, please.","""Attached"""
330,WORF,"   Aye, sir.","""Attached"""
331,LORIN,"   Enterprise, I have warned you   about these unauthorized   communications...","""Attached"""
332,RIKER,"   Yes, I know. But I think it's   about time we all sat down   together and tried to work this   out. I have Ambassador Mauric   here and --","""Attached"""
333,LORIN,   That is your misfortune. We have   nothing to say to either of you.,"""Attached"""
334,MAURIC,       Commander... I know you're working   with the Prytt. Putting on a   little show like that for my   benefit does neither of us any   good.,"""Attached"""
335,RIKER,   We'll see.       Mister Worf...,"""Attached"""
336,RIKER,       I think there's someone waiting   for us in the Observation Lounge.,"""Attached"""
337,LORIN,   I should have known that anyone   willing to deal with the Kes would   be capable of such an outrage.,"""Attached"""
338,RIKER,"   I'm sorry I had to resort to these   drastic measures, Minister, but   you left me little choice.","""Attached"""
339,MAURIC,   Don't pretend that the two of you   are enemies. It is too late for   a charade.,"""Attached"""
340,LORIN,"   If that is an attempt to hide your   military alliance with the   Federation, you needn't bother.   I already know far more than you   can imagine.","""Attached"""
341,RIKER,   Let's all just sit down and try to   talk about what's happened to   Captain Picard and Doctor Crusher.,"""Attached"""
342,LORIN,   I will not sit at a table with...   him.,"""Attached"""
343,MAURIC,       No more than I would sit with her.,"""Attached"""
344,RIKER,   All right... then we'll stand.   The important thing is that we   start talking.,"""Attached"""
345,LORIN,   I am not authorized to talk with   a Kes official.,"""Attached"""
346,RIKER,   Then talk to me. Where are my   officers?,"""Attached"""
347,MAURIC,       As if you don't already know.,"""Attached"""
348,PICARD,   I'm all right.,"""Attached"""
349,LORIN,   We are already aware of your plan   to use Federation technology to   build new attack satellites. You   will find that we are prepared for   them.,"""Attached"""
350,MAURIC,"   An interesting, if pointless lie.   I would rather discuss your own   plans to use Federation aid to   stage a takeover of Kolrod Island.","""Attached"""
351,LORIN,   We have been over this before.   Kolrod clearly belongs to the   Prytt who originally--,"""Attached"""
352,RIKER,       That's it.,"""Attached"""
353,RIKER,"       I can see that... diplomacy is not   going to get us anywhere today,   and I don't have time for an   extended negotiation session. So   it's time to lay all the cards on   the table.","""Attached"""
354,RIKER,       That means it's time to stop   fooling around and get serious.       You're concerned that the Kes are   about to be admitted into an   associative membership with the   Federation.,"""Attached"""
355,LORIN,   Correct.,"""Attached"""
356,RIKER,   As First Officer of the Enterprise   I think I can promise you that is   not going to happen. The Kes will   be denied membership.,"""Attached"""
357,MAURIC,"   You do not have the authority to   do that. Despite whatever games   you may have played with the Prytt   since your arrival, we still plan   on taking our petition directly to   the Federation Council. They will   listen to our--","""Attached"""
358,RIKER,"   They will listen to the report of   the Enterprise Captain and his   First Officer. And I can tell you   right now that the First Officer's   report will go something like   this:    (he moves about the     room)   ""Kesprytt is a deeply troubled   world with social, political, and   military problems that it has yet   to resolve. The Kes, although a   friendly and democratic people,   are driven by suspicion,   deviousness, and paranoia. In the   opinion of this officer, they are   not ready for membership.""","""Attached"""
359,RIKER,   Now to the matter of our missing   officers...,"""Attached"""
360,LORIN,"   They are still charged with   spying, Commander. I have heard   nothing here which would alter   that.","""Attached"""
361,RIKER,"   Then maybe you should consider   this: If anything happens to them,   Starfleet is going to want a full   investigation. That means more   starships will be sent to   Kesprytt... and those ships are   going to want answers... which   means they'll be putting your   country under a very large and   very uncomfortable microscope.","""Attached"""
362,RIKER,"       Remember how unhappy you were when   we contacted just one of your   people without authorization?   Well, think of what it'll be like   when ten starships start looking   for answers. They'll be   contacting hundreds of your   people... they'll conduct massive   sensor sweeps... they might even   start sending down Away Teams.   And all because you wouldn't help   me find my missing officers...","""Attached"""
363,BEVERLY,   I think I can use the tricorder to   set-up a multiphase pulse. That   should weaken the field enough for   us to get through.,"""Attached"""
364,PICARD,"   No, no. The modulation frequency   should be in the upper-harmonic   range.","""Attached"""
365,BEVERLY,   Right.,"""Attached"""
366,BEVERLY,   I'm going as fast as I can.,"""Attached"""
367,TROOPER,"   Minister, we have the human   female. The male is standing in   Kes territory.","""Attached"""
368,LORIN,   Very well. Transmit their   coordinates to the Enterprise   Transporter Room.,"""Attached"""
369,TROOPER,   Understood.,"""Attached"""
370,RIKER,"   Thank you, Minister. Now, if   you'll excuse me...","""Attached"""
371,RIKER,"   Mauric is determined to take his   protest to the Federation Council,   but I don't think he'll get very   far.","""Attached"""
372,PICARD,"   I tend to agree, Number One.","""Attached"""
373,RIKER,   Did I miss something?,"""Attached"""
374,PICARD,       I know... I know... you're   absolutely right.,"""Attached"""
375,BEVERLY,       That was wonderful.,"""Attached"""
376,PICARD,   My pleasure.,"""Attached"""
377,BEVERLY,"   Don't take this the wrong way,   Jean-Luc... but I'm glad we're not   joined at the hip anymore.","""Attached"""
378,PICARD,   Were you getting tired of my   company?,"""Attached"""
379,BEVERLY,   Just tired of bumping into you   every thirty seconds. I was   beginning to feel like you were   part of my uniform.,"""Attached"""

384,BEVERLY,   Penny for your thoughts.,"""Attached"""

386,BEVERLY,   So was I. It was very...   intimate.,"""Attached"""
387,BEVERLY,   You know... last night... I woke   up...,"""Attached"""
388,PICARD,   Oh?,"""Attached"""
389,BEVERLY,"   I was awake for several hours.   And thanks to the implant, I got   to ""hear"" some very interesting   dreams of yours.","""Attached"""
