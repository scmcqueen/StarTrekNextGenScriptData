5,RIKER,   Is it true that he'll be   retiring after this mission?,"""Sarek"""
6,PICARD,"   Unofficially, that's what I hear.   And what a crowning achievement   this will be to his career. The   benefits of relations with the   Legarans are incalculable.","""Sarek"""

15,PICARD,"   Yes, I believe that the ambassador   is extremely fond of Mozart.","""Sarek"""

57,RIKER,"   The way Mendrossen described him,   I expected him to be a frail old   man.","""Sarek"""
58,PICARD,"   I hope I'm that frail when I'm   two hundred and two. His aides   did seem a little overprotective,   didn't they?","""Sarek"""

60,PICARD,"   Nevertheless, we will honor Mister   Mendrossen's request and allow   Ambassador Sarek his privacy.       I suppose they were foolish and   vain, my expectations of this   voyage.

72,PICARD,   I find that hard to believe.,"""Sarek"""

107,RIKER,   Something wrong?,"""Sarek"""
108,RIKER,    (edge of command in     voice)   I asked a question.,"""Sarek"""

117,PICARD,"   Ambassador Sarek, Perrin... on   behalf of my entire crew, welcome.","""Sarek"""
118,SAREK,   It was my wife's suggestion that   we attend... and it seemed an   ideal diversion. My wife can be   quite logical when she so chooses.,"""Sarek"""

144,TROI,"   And Wesley didn't provoke you in   any way? It wasn't anything he   said, anything he did?","""Sarek"""
145,BEVERLY,   No. It was a sudden... burst of   anger. I still can't believe I   did it.,"""Sarek"""
146,TROI,"   I don't know why you did it either,   Beverly. But I can tell you that   I've heard the same kind of story   from ten different people in the   past two days.","""Sarek"""

194,TROI,   Vulcans possess telepathic   ability. Sarek could be   unintentionally projecting these   intense emotions onto other   people... at random.,"""Sarek"""
