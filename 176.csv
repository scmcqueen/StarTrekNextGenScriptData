88,TROI,   Captain... if Jeremiah were   returned to his family in his   present condition... it would be   a wrenching experience for   everyone. Especially for him.   He needs to re-discover his   identity. He has to make some   connection with his roots.,"""Suddenly Human"""

107,JONO,   Are you going to return me to my   Captain?,"""Suddenly Human"""
108,PICARD,       We will rendezvous with the   warship Q'maire at   Oh-seven-forty. We are   preparing to transfer the   Talarians to Captain Endar.,"""Suddenly Human"""

118,PICARD,   Yes. Put it back where you got   it.,"""Suddenly Human"""

124,PICARD,"   Jono... your Captain, Endar? Has   he ever hurt you?       Inflicted pain?","""Suddenly Human"""
125,JONO,       Pain is not a consideration.,"""Suddenly Human"""
126,PICARD,   Then he has.,"""Suddenly Human"""
127,JONO,   I did not say that. Can't you   understand? Pain is not what   matters. Passing the tests is   everything.,"""Suddenly Human"""
128,PICARD,   Is that what they are? Tests of   pain?,"""Suddenly Human"""
129,JONO,       You don't understand anything.,"""Suddenly Human"""
130,PICARD,   It's true I don't fully understand   Talarians. But... you are not   Talarian.,"""Suddenly Human"""
131,JONO,   I will not listen to this! I will   not listen to your lies! Take   me back to my cell! I'd rather   be in prison than have you try   to poison my mind!,"""Suddenly Human"""
132,PICARD,   Come.,"""Suddenly Human"""

134,PICARD,"   Ah, yes, Counselor. Please --   sit down.","""Suddenly Human"""
135,PICARD,"   You may not be aware of this, but   I have never been particularly   comfortable around children.","""Suddenly Human"""
136,TROI,   Really?,"""Suddenly Human"""
137,PICARD,"   For some reason, they just don't   seem to respond to me.","""Suddenly Human"""
138,TROI,   I see...,"""Suddenly Human"""
139,PICARD,"   Frankly, I think my time is best   served carrying out the duties   and responsibilities of a   Starfleet Captain.","""Suddenly Human"""
140,TROI,   Seldom have I heard an explanation   so well rehearsed.,"""Suddenly Human"""
141,PICARD,"   All right, Counselor... I just   don't think I'm the right person   for this job.","""Suddenly Human"""
142,TROI,"   Strange, isn't it? You'll travel   light years, dodge asteroid   storms, brave hostile aliens...   but when asked to assume a   parental role, you cringe. Why   do you suppose that is?","""Suddenly Human"""
143,PICARD,   I'm not cringing... I am simply   acknowledging my limitations.,"""Suddenly Human"""
144,TROI,"       When you were a child, did you   have many friends? Other children   you played with?","""Suddenly Human"""
145,PICARD,"   No, but I don't think that has   anything to do with anything...       Perhaps it's because... no, this   is foolish. What does it matter?","""Suddenly Human"""
146,TROI,   What were you going to say?,"""Suddenly Human"""
147,PICARD,   Just that... ever since I was a   child... I knew exactly what I   wanted -- to be a member of   Starfleet. Nothing else mattered   to me. Virtually my entire youth   was spent pursuing that goal.   In fact...       I think... that I may have skipped   my childhood.,"""Suddenly Human"""
148,TROI,"   You know, Captain, almost no one   is born being a good parent.     ","""Suddenly Human"""
149,,,"""Suddenly Human"""
150,TROI ,"   Most people simply have to muddle   through it, doing the best job   they can.","""Suddenly Human"""
151,PICARD,   And... that's what I'm going to   have to do?,"""Suddenly Human"""
152,TROI,   Yes. And you might be surprised   at how good you could be.,"""Suddenly Human"""
153,PICARD,"   Computer, turn off that noise!","""Suddenly Human"""
154,PICARD,"   Computer, what was that?","""Suddenly Human"""
155,COMPUTER,"   The ""Alba Ra""... a contemporary   Talarian musical form.","""Suddenly Human"""
156,PICARD,   Jono? Where are you?,"""Suddenly Human"""
157,JONO,   Here.,"""Suddenly Human"""
158,JONO,   You turned off my music.,"""Suddenly Human"""
159,PICARD,"   Yes, I certainly did, and I expect   it to stay turned off. Jono,   would you come down from there?","""Suddenly Human"""
160,PICARD,       I see you've made yourself at   home.,"""Suddenly Human"""
161,JONO,       I cannot rest on your beds. They   hurt my back.,"""Suddenly Human"""
162,PICARD,"   Right... Jono, I want to show you   something.","""Suddenly Human"""
163,PICARD,   Those are Connor and Moira Rossa   -- your parents. That baby is   you... Jeremiah Rossa.,"""Suddenly Human"""

165,PICARD,"   You were born Jeremiah, on Galen   Four. Your colony was   destroyed, later, during a border   skirmish.","""Suddenly Human"""
166,PICARD,   You knew how to laugh once.,"""Suddenly Human"""
167,PICARD,"   Do you remember any of that? Your   parents, your home?","""Suddenly Human"""
168,JONO,   No. I know that Endar rescued   me. He told me so.,"""Suddenly Human"""
169,PICARD,"   Jono, your parents were killed   by Talarians...","""Suddenly Human"""
170,JONO,       It was war. Death is part of war.,"""Suddenly Human"""
171,RIKER,   Captain?,"""Suddenly Human"""
172,PICARD,"   What is it, Number One?","""Suddenly Human"""
173,RIKER,   We have visual contact with the   warship Q'Maire.,"""Suddenly Human"""
174,JONO,   Endar...,"""Suddenly Human"""

183,ENDAR,   I am Captain Endar of the warship   Q'Maire. To whom am I speaking?,"""Suddenly Human"""
184,PICARD,   Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the   Federation Starship Enterprise.   We have rescued four crew members   from your observation craft. They   have received medical attention   and are ready for transport.,"""Suddenly Human"""
185,ENDAR,   Your actions are duly noted. We   will forward coordinates for   immediate transport.,"""Suddenly Human"""

194,ENDAR,"   No explanation is warranted,   Captain. He is my son!","""Suddenly Human"""
195,PICARD ,"   Captain's log, supplemental:   Endar's claim that Jeremiah Rossa   is his son is clearly   unacceptable.","""Suddenly Human"""

197,ENDAR,   Yes... I was in charge of the   force that repelled the   trespassers on Galen Four.       I must say your Federation troops   fought tenaciously.,"""Suddenly Human"""
198,PICARD,   Among them Connor and Moira Rossa.,"""Suddenly Human"""
199,ENDAR,"   I suppose. After the battle, I   found this squalling child,   huddled by the body of a young   woman. His mother, presumably.","""Suddenly Human"""
200,PICARD,"   And so, you -- kidnapped him.","""Suddenly Human"""
201,ENDAR,"   A harsh term, Captain. I rescued   the child. There was almost no   one left alive on Galen Four...   was I to leave him screaming by   his mother's body?","""Suddenly Human"""
202,PICARD,   You should have notified   Federation authorities. To   conceal him was a clear violation   of our agreement.,"""Suddenly Human"""
203,ENDAR,   I took him in accordance with   my peoples' traditions.,"""Suddenly Human"""
204,PICARD,   What... tradition... is it that   empowered you to capture a   helpless child?,"""Suddenly Human"""
205,ENDAR,   I lost my son at the hands of   humans during the conflict over   Castal One. Talarian custom   allows me to claim the son of a   slain enemy.,"""Suddenly Human"""

213,ENDAR,"   Jono broke his ribs riding a   T'stayan -- six hooves, a very   powerful animal. The arm? In   a contest with other youths. He   endured the pain -- and won the   competition.       He will be a great warrior one   day.","""Suddenly Human"""
214,PICARD,   Doesn't he deserve to become more   than that?,"""Suddenly Human"""
215,PICARD,"   His heritage is human, Endar.","""Suddenly Human"""

217,PICARD,"       Captain Endar, while on board,   you are welcome to supervise the   return of your crew. But I cannot   allow Jeremiah Rossa to be   returned to your custody. His   true family is waiting for him   on Earth.","""Suddenly Human"""

225,TROI,   Those were your parents. Do you   remember them?,"""Suddenly Human"""
226,JONO,   That was long ago. Endar is my   father.,"""Suddenly Human"""
227,TROI,   And who is your mother?,"""Suddenly Human"""
228,JONO,   We don't have mothers. Females   are only for mating. And work.,"""Suddenly Human"""

236,TROI,   And when you look at this   picture... of you and the human   female who was your mother...   how do you feel about her?,"""Suddenly Human"""
237,PICARD,   Then you think it would be unwise   to let Endar see Jono.,"""Suddenly Human"""
238,BEVERLY,   I think it's dangerous. Abusers   can have subtle but powerful   influence over their victims.,"""Suddenly Human"""
