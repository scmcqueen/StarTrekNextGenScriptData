36,GEORDI,   They won't be very effective. The   interference will make it   difficult to maintain contact with   the probes; the best we can do is   to try increasing the sensor   efficiency.

435,,,"""Force of Nature"""
436,PICARD ,   It now appears certain that what   we've seen here will have   repercussions for many years to   come.,"""Force of Nature"""
437,GEORDI,"   Our scans have shown a lot of   subspace instabilities all through   the sector. If they're exposed to   enough warp energy, they might   eventually create other rifts.","""Force of Nature"""
438,RABAL,"   Based on current warp drive   patterns in the sector, we've   projected where subspace rifts   will be most likely to form in the   next forty years.       This is the way things are now...","""Force of Nature"""
439,RABAL,   This is how they'll look in ten   years...,"""Force of Nature"""
440,PICARD,"       Thank you, gentlemen.","""Force of Nature"""
441,PICARD,       We've received new directives from   the Federation Council on this   matter...,"""Force of Nature"""
442,PICARD,"       Until we can find a way to   counteract the warp field effect,   the Council feels our best course   is to slow the damage as much as   possible...       Therefore, areas of space found   susceptible to warp fields will be   restricted to essential travel   only...       And effective immediately, all   Federation vessels will be limited   to a speed of warp five, except in   cases of extreme emergency.","""Force of Nature"""
443,WORF,"   Sir, the Klingons will observe   these restrictions, but the   Romulans will not.","""Force of Nature"""
444,TROI,   And what about the Ferengi... and   the Cardassians for that matter?,"""Force of Nature"""
445,PICARD,   The Federation is sharing our data   with all known warp-capable   species.     ,"""Force of Nature"""

447,PICARD ,   All we can hope is that they   realize it's in their best   interests to take similar action.,"""Force of Nature"""
448,BEVERLY,   Putting limits on warp speed is   only going to prevent other rifts   from forming. What are we going   to do about this one?,"""Force of Nature"""
449,GEORDI,"   Unfortunately, right now there's   not much we can do.","""Force of Nature"""
450,RABAL,"   My planet is not in immediate   danger, but the gravitational   shifts are already beginning to   affect its orbit. Our climate is   changing.","""Force of Nature"""
451,PICARD,"   Starfleet is setting up a weather   control network for Hekaras Two.   It's only a temporary solution,   but it should suffice for now.","""Force of Nature"""
452,RIKER,   We were lucky the rift formed as   far away from the planet as it   did. At least we have a little   time to consider our options.,"""Force of Nature"""
