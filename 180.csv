264,PICARD,"       Her ship had responded to their   distress call, as had mine. When   it was all over, I requested that   Tasha be assigned to the   Enterprise.       Her ship's captain owed me a   favor.","""Legacy"""
265,PICARD,"       In the months that followed, Tasha   never once failed to put the   safety of the crew before her own.       She died doing the same.","""Legacy"""
266,PICARD,   I'm sorry you never knew the woman   Tasha became. I think you might   have been proud of her.     ,"""Legacy"""
267,,,"""Legacy"""
268,PICARD ,       And she of you.,"""Legacy"""
269,DATA,   What is this structure?,"""Legacy"""
270,ISHARA,   A main fusion source -- there's   one next to each of the Alliance   headquarters. It powers all their   defensive systems.,"""Legacy"""
271,ISHARA,   This chamber is accessed from the   level below. Entry points are   evenly spaced along this wall   every twenty-five meters.,"""Legacy"""
272,ISHARA,   Data... Where was Tasha's post?,"""Legacy"""
273,DATA,   The Tactical Station -- where   Lieutenant Worf is now.,"""Legacy"""
274,ISHARA,   Did Tasha have many friends here?,"""Legacy"""
275,DATA,   Yes. She was especially close   to Commander Riker and Lieutenant   Worf. And to myself.,"""Legacy"""
276,ISHARA,       Are you able to have friends?,"""Legacy"""
277,DATA,   Yes.,"""Legacy"""
278,ISHARA,"   But you don't have feelings, do   you?","""Legacy"""
279,DATA,"   Not as such. However, perhaps   even among humans, friendship is   sometimes less an emotional   response, and more a sense of   familiarity.","""Legacy"""
280,ISHARA,       You can become used to someone.,"""Legacy"""
281,DATA,"   Exactly. As I experience certain   sensory input patterns, my mental   pathways become accustomed to   them. The inputs eventually are   anticipated. And even ""missed""   when absent. When something once   expected is no longer there.","""Legacy"""
282,ISHARA,       Like my sister.,"""Legacy"""
283,DATA,   Yes. Like your sister.,"""Legacy"""
284,GEORDI,   They've been moved so far   underground that it took awhile   to pinpoint their signatures.,"""Legacy"""

287,RIKER,   So much for the transporter.,"""Legacy"""
288,GEORDI,   Not necessarily. We could use   the ship's phasers to cut a shaft   through the bedrock to this   storage tunnel here.,"""Legacy"""
289,GEORDI ,"   With a clear path through the   rock, we'd be able to transport   down to the tunnel. That would   put us close enough to get to the   crewmen.","""Legacy"""
290,GEORDI,       It would take me a few hours to   adjust the phasers for drilling.,"""Legacy"""
291,RIKER,   It's a maze around there...,"""Legacy"""
292,ISHARA,       I spent a lot of time in that   section before they took it over.   There are blind tunnels and dead   ends that don't even show up on   this map.,"""Legacy"""
293,WORF,   We don't have much choice.,"""Legacy"""
294,ISHARA,"   If it wasn't for my implant   setting off all the alarms, I   could guide you to your men.","""Legacy"""
295,DATA,   We could remove the implant.,"""Legacy"""
296,ISHARA,"   It has a micro-explosive inside   that detonates on contact with   air. When you join a cadre, you   join for life.","""Legacy"""
297,DATA,   A small force field containing   xenon or another inert gas could   be placed over the incision site.   The explosive could thereby be   safely disarmed at the same time   it is removed.,"""Legacy"""
298,RIKER,"   It's more than just a tactical   device to you, isn't it? It's   part of your identity.","""Legacy"""
299,RIKER,"       This is something you'll have to   decide for yourself, Ishara.   Think about it while we're waiting   for Geordi.","""Legacy"""
300,ISHARA,"   Our parents were killed in some   crossfire just after I was born.   Some people took care of us for   a few months... Then one day we   came home and they were gone.   So Tasha took care of me. And   when I got old enough, I joined   the Coalition.","""Legacy"""
301,DATA,   And Tasha did not?,"""Legacy"""
302,ISHARA,   My sister hated the cadres.   Blamed them for our parents death.   For everything. She refused to   join. And she left as soon as   she had the chance.,"""Legacy"""
303,ISHARA,       I always thought she was weak for   doing that...,"""Legacy"""
304,ISHARA,       But maybe I was wrong. Maybe   she made the right choice.,"""Legacy"""
305,ISHARA,       To work together for something   besides killing... to be close   to someone without having to   protect your back.,"""Legacy"""
306,DATA,   You find that appealing?,"""Legacy"""
307,ISHARA,"   Very appealing. You're a perfect   example. I hardly even know you   Data, but already I completely   trust you. I even consider you   my friend.","""Legacy"""

311,DATA,   Ishara is willing to have the   implant removed.,"""Legacy"""
312,PICARD,   Very good. You may inform Doctor   Crusher.,"""Legacy"""
313,DATA,   She also expressed a desire to   leave the colony. She hopes   to apply to the Academy and   eventually join Starfleet.,"""Legacy"""
314,PICARD,   Does she understand the magnitude   of these decisions?,"""Legacy"""
315,DATA,"   She claims to, Captain.","""Legacy"""
316,PICARD,   Her courage certainly speaks in   her favor. But Ishara's personal   history concerns me.,"""Legacy"""
317,DATA,"   Did her sister not come from the   very same environment, Sir?","""Legacy"""
318,PICARD,   Tasha never joined one of these   gangs. Doesn't that suggest a   fundamental difference between   the two of them?,"""Legacy"""
319,DATA,"   I do not know. But I do know that   often for humans, decisions made   in youth only hold true for youth.","""Legacy"""
320,TROI,"   I get a sense of ambiguity from   her. Her loyalties are clearly   divided, Captain, no matter what   she may say.","""Legacy"""
321,PICARD,"   Are you suggesting we deny her   an escape from this environment,   Counselor?","""Legacy"""
322,TROI,   No... I'm just not convinced she   really wants to escape. It is   the only way of life she's ever   known.,"""Legacy"""
323,PICARD,"   Ultimately, it is her decision   to make, not ours...       Certainly nothing would please   me more than to see another   officer named Yar in the service   of Starfleet... Mister Data,   proceed with the rescue as   discussed...","""Legacy"""

325,DATA,"       Yes, Counselor?","""Legacy"""
326,TROI,   You seem so strong in your   support. I'm curious...,"""Legacy"""

334,ISHARA,"   On the colony, nobody does   anything for anyone else unless   they have something to gain from   it.","""Legacy"""
335,DATA,   But I do have something to gain.   Your continued presence on this   ship.,"""Legacy"""
