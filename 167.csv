22,RIKER,"       Counselor, is it my imagination   or is something bothering the   captain?","""Captain's Holiday"""

104,VASH,       Welcome to Risa.,"""Captain's Holiday"""

106,JOVAL ,   Return.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
107,JOVAL,   My apologies. I fear I have yet   to master the art of hoverball.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
108,PICARD,   So it would seem.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
109,JOVAL,   My name is Joval. I am employed   here. Is there anything you   require to make your stay a more   pleasant one?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
110,JOVAL,   You find me amusing.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
111,PICARD,   No. It's just that you're the   fifth woman to ask me that this   morning... All I require is to   sit here in the sun and read my   book. Alone.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
112,JOVAL,   And afterward?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
113,PICARD,   I really haven't thought that far   ahead.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
114,JOVAL,   Then may I suggest a swim to be   followed by a massage?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
115,PICARD,   Some other time perhaps.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
116,JOVAL,   I don't understand. You say you   wish to be alone yet you carry   the Horga'hn.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
117,PICARD,   I just purchased that.       Why? Are you implying it holds   some special meaning?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
118,JOVAL,   The Horga'hn is the Risian   symbol of sexuality. To own   one is to call forth it powers.   To display it is to announce you   are seeking Jamaharohn.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
119,PICARD,    (softly but     emphatically)   Riker!,"""Captain's Holiday"""
120,JOVAL,   Do you seek Jamaharohn?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
121,PICARD,   I don't even know what it means.       Nor do I want to. The Horga'hn   is for a friend.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
122,JOVAL,   I see. Someone close to you.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
123,PICARD,   That's right.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
124,JOVAL,   Someone you love.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
125,PICARD,   I wouldn't go that far.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
126,JOVAL,   Your attitude is most puzzling.   I will leave you now to your book.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
127,PICARD,   That's all I ask.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
128,PICARD ,   You're blocking the sun.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
129,SOVAK,"   I know you're working with her.   I warn you, it's a mistake.","""Captain's Holiday"""
130,PICARD,   Are you addressing me?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
131,SOVAK,   Don't bother to deny it. I've   seen the two of you together.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
132,PICARD,"   I don't know what the devil you're   talking about. But whatever it   is, I assure you it's no concern   of mine.","""Captain's Holiday"""
133,SOVAK,   Tell her I want the disc returned   to me immediately.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
134,PICARD,   Perhaps I haven't made myself   clear. You have the wrong man.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
135,SOVAK,   I am rapidly losing patience with   you. I demand you talk business.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
136,PICARD,   You'll find Ferengi demands carry   little weight with me.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
137,SOVAK,   Obviously you've never dealt with   my people before.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
138,PICARD,"   On the contrary, I have. All too   often.","""Captain's Holiday"""
139,SOVAK,   Then you know the Ferengi are not   to be trifled with.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
140,PICARD,   Or trusted.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
141,SOVAK,   You dare to insult me!,"""Captain's Holiday"""
142,PICARD,"   I advise you to listen closely   for I will not say this again.   I came to Risa for a holiday,   nothing more. I have no knowledge   of this woman you refer to, nor   have I laid eyes on any disc.","""Captain's Holiday"""
143,SOVAK,   You expect me to believe such   feeble lies?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
144,PICARD,       I don't particularly care what   you believe.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
145,SOVAK,"   This is not over yet, human. The   disc is mine... And so is the   woman. Remember that.","""Captain's Holiday"""
146,VASH ,   Hello!,"""Captain's Holiday"""
147,PICARD,"   Oh, it's you.","""Captain's Holiday"""
148,VASH,   That's not much of a greeting.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
149,PICARD,"   Look, I don't mean to appear rude,   but I am not seeking Jamaharohn.","""Captain's Holiday"""
150,VASH,   All right. But you really should   try it some time.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
151,PICARD,"   If I ""try it"", it will be at a   time of my own choosing.","""Captain's Holiday"""
152,VASH,   That's fine with me. It's not   as though I was offering to help   you find it.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
153,PICARD,   I assumed by the way you welcomed   me the other day...,"""Captain's Holiday"""
154,VASH,   I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
155,PICARD,   I don't recall saying I was   embarrassed.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
156,VASH,   Do public displays of affection   normally make you uncomfortable?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
157,PICARD,   Let's just say I prefer to be   acquainted with the women I kiss.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
158,VASH,   That's understandable. The name's   Vash.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
159,PICARD,   Jean-Luc Picard.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
160,VASH,"   So tell me about yourself,   Jean-Luc.","""Captain's Holiday"""
161,PICARD,       Is that really necessary?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
162,VASH,   Would you rather I guess? I can   be very persistent.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
163,PICARD,   I'm captain of a Federation   starship.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
164,VASH,   Well then that explains it.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
165,PICARD,   Explains what?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
166,VASH,   I noticed you arguing with that   Ferengi. For a moment there it   looked like it was going to come   to blows.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
167,PICARD,   You're the woman he was talking   about?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
168,VASH,   I hope your disagreement wasn't   over me.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
169,PICARD,   For the answer to that I suggest   you ask him.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
170,VASH,   Where are you going?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
171,PICARD,   To find some privacy.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
172,VASH,   Wait a second.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
173,VASH,   What did he tell you? I'm sure   there wasn't a bit of truth to   any of it.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
174,SOVAK,       And you said you didn't know her.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
175,PICARD,   I don't. And I don't want to.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
176,SOVAK,       Return the disc to me and all will   be forgiven.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
177,VASH,"   The disc doesn't belong to you,   Sovak. It never did.","""Captain's Holiday"""
178,PICARD,   It would seem you two have a lot   to discuss. If you'll excuse   me...,"""Captain's Holiday"""
179,VASH,"   I'm sorry, Jean-Luc. Perhaps one   day I can explain this all to you.","""Captain's Holiday"""
180,PICARD,   Perhaps you can.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
181,SOVAK,   I have a proposal I believe you'll   find most interesting.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
182,VASH,   Save your breath.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
183,SOVAK,   I am willing to pay you your   weight in gold in exchange for   the disc. Is that not a generous   offer?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
184,SOVAK,       I must have that woman.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
185,PICARD,   What are you doing in my room?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
186,AJUR,   We are Vorgons. I am Ajur. This   is Boratus.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
187,BORATUS,   We come from the twenty-seventh   century. We've traveled three   hundred years into the past to   find you.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
188,PICARD,   Let's assume for the moment I   believe you. That you are indeed   from the future. What is it that   you want from me?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
189,AJUR,   Have you heard of the Tox Uthat?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
190,PICARD,   I'm aware of the legend. It tells   of a visitor from the future who   left behind a mysterious device   known as the Tox Uthat.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
191,AJUR,   Essentially that story is correct.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
192,PICARD,   Then the Uthat actually exists.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
193,BORATUS,       It was invented by a scientist   named Kal Dano in the mid-twenty-seventh   century. The Uthat is a   quantum phase inhibitor... capable   of halting all nuclear reaction   within a star.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
194,PICARD,   But why bring such a powerful   weapon into the past?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
195,BORATUS,"   Criminals attempted to steal the   device from Dano. He was   determined to keep it out of their   hands, so he fled back to the   twenty-second century... where   he hid it.","""Captain's Holiday"""
196,BORATUS,"       Ajur and I were the security team   assigned to protect the Uthat.   Having failed in our duty, we   followed Dano into the past,   hoping to return him and the   weapon safely to our own time.","""Captain's Holiday"""
197,PICARD,   I gather you were unsuccessful.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
198,AJUR,"   Though we searched for many years,   we were unable to find any trace   of it.","""Captain's Holiday"""
199,BORATUS,   Returning home in defeat we began   to search through the historical   records for some clue to the   Uthat's fate.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
200,AJUR,   For years we looked through the   archives of the many cultures that   reside in this part of the galaxy.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
201,PICARD,   And the search led you to me?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
202,AJUR,   We came upon a brief account   stating you had discovered an   object of unknown origin while   vacationing on Risa. From its   description -- a crystal cube that   fits in the palm of the hand -- we   surmised it could very well be   the Uthat.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
203,PICARD,"   I'm sorry to disappoint you, but   I haven't found a thing -- including   peace, which is the only thing   I'm looking for.","""Captain's Holiday"""
204,BORATUS,"   You will find such a device,   Captain -- to us it's already part   of history.","""Captain's Holiday"""
205,PICARD,"   And if I do find it, what then?","""Captain's Holiday"""
206,AJUR,   You will give it to us immediately   so that we may return with it.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
207,BORATUS,"   Can we expect your cooperation,   Picard?","""Captain's Holiday"""
208,PICARD,   The Uthat belongs to your time   -- not mine.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
209,AJUR,"       It would appear that history is   correct in its assessment of you,   Captain. You are a very wise man.","""Captain's Holiday"""
210,PICARD ,   May I come in?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
211,VASH,   Excuse the mess.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
212,VASH,   Sovak has taken to searching my   room periodically.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
213,PICARD,   Is this what he's looking for?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
214,VASH,"   I'm sorry I had to hide it like   that, but I was afraid he'd start   searching me next.","""Captain's Holiday"""
215,PICARD,   This disc must contain some very   valuable information.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
216,VASH,   I doubt it's anything you'd be   interested in.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
217,PICARD,   That depends.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
218,VASH,   On what?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
219,PICARD,   On whether or not this has   anything to do with the Tox Uthat.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
220,VASH,       Did Sovak tell you that?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
221,PICARD,   Let's just say I've heard...   rumors that the Uthat is located   somewhere on Risa.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
222,VASH,"   Look, the last thing I need is   a partner.","""Captain's Holiday"""
223,PICARD,   Then it's true.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
224,VASH,   I don't suppose you ever heard   of Professor Samuel Estragon?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
225,PICARD,"   As a matter of fact, I have. He   spent half his life searching for   the Uthat.       Archaeology is a hobby of mine.","""Captain's Holiday"""
226,VASH,"   I served as his personal   assistant for the past five years.   Shortly before he died, he   uncovered new data pinpointing   its location. That disc contains   his research notes and maps.","""Captain's Holiday"""
227,PICARD,   So you're continuing his work?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
228,VASH,   Exactly.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
229,PICARD,   With a Ferengi as an associate.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
230,VASH,   Sovak and I are definitely not   working together.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
231,PICARD,   But the two of you are well   acquainted.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
232,VASH,   At times he aided the professor   in his explorations. Especially   in situations that weren't quite   ethical.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
233,PICARD,"   And now with typical Ferengi   logic, he's convinced that the   Uthat belongs to him.","""Captain's Holiday"""
234,VASH,   All he cares about is selling it   to the highest bidder.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
235,PICARD,   I take it you have a more noble   purpose in mind.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
236,VASH,   I told the professor I'd present   it to the Daystrom Institute.       But first I have to find it.   And that won't be easy with Sovak   watching me every minute.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
237,PICARD,   Then I'll go in your place.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
238,VASH,   And what about me?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
239,PICARD,   You'll remain here. It's safer.,"""Captain's Holiday"""

241,VASH,   You'd never find it without me.   The professor's notes are in code.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
242,PICARD,   From the moment we met I knew you   were going to be trouble.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
243,VASH,   You look like a man who could   handle trouble.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
244,PICARD,   How far is it to our destination?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
245,VASH,"   According to the professor's notes,   a series of subterranrean caves lie   twenty-nine kilometers due east.   That's where we'll find the Uthat.","""Captain's Holiday"""
246,PICARD,   I'll meet you in the lobby in   fifteen minutes. Be punctual.       I advise you to change clothing.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
247,VASH,   Jean-Luc...,"""Captain's Holiday"""
248,VASH,   ... We're going to make a wonderful   team.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
249,SOVAK,   I expected such treachery. Did   you think you could sneak away   from me so easily?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
250,SOVAK,   The disc -- where is it?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
251,PICARD,   Didn't anyone tell you weapons   aren't allowed on Risa?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
252,SOVAK,   You're making a grave mistake   putting your trust in this woman.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
253,VASH,   It would be a worse mistake to   trust you.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
254,SOVAK,   Silence!       Do you know how she acquired the   disc in the first place?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
255,VASH,       Sovak!,"""Captain's Holiday"""
256,SOVAK,"       I paid her to steal it. But   instead she betrayed me, and   used my money to make her way   here.","""Captain's Holiday"""
257,VASH,   That's not the way it happened.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
258,SOVAK,       She's a greedy and unscrupulous   woman.       A perfect mate for a Ferengi.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
259,PICARD,"   You are becoming quite an   annoyance, Sovak.","""Captain's Holiday"""
260,SOVAK,"   As are you, human. Perhaps I   should kill you and then take the   disc.","""Captain's Holiday"""
261,VASH,   No wait... you can have it.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
262,VASH,"   You see, I told you we'd make a   good team.","""Captain's Holiday"""
263,PICARD,   We have a long trip ahead of us.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
264,AJUR,   So it finally begins.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
265,BORATUS,   Picard must not be allowed to   destroy the Uthat.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
266,AJUR,   He will surrender it to us...   or die.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
267,PICARD,   Have you calculated how much   further we have to go?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
268,VASH,   Another eleven kilometers.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
269,PICARD,   We'll remain here for the night.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
270,VASH,   I was hoping you'd say that.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
271,PICARD,   We made better time than I   expected.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
272,VASH,   I'll take that as a compliment.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
273,PICARD,   As it was intended.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
274,VASH,   Jean-Luc... I'm afraid I haven't   been totally honest with you.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
275,PICARD,   Forgive me if I don't act   surprised.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
276,VASH,   Sovak did pay me to hand over the   disc.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
277,PICARD,   Then you did steal it.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
278,VASH,   It wasn't stealing. The professor   was dead... Someone had to   continue his work. I had already   devoted five years of my life to   tracking down the Uthat.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
279,PICARD,   But you took Sovak's money.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
280,VASH,"   It was the only way I could afford   to get to Risa. As for Sovak,   he got exactly what he deserved.","""Captain's Holiday"""
281,PICARD,"   Well, any woman who can beat a   Ferengi at his own game, bears   watching.","""Captain's Holiday"""
282,VASH,   I'll take that as another   compliment. I am flattered.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
283,PICARD,       We should get some sleep.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
284,VASH,"   You know Jean-Luc, it's lucky for   you we met.","""Captain's Holiday"""
285,VASH,"   If it wasn't for me, you'd still   be back there sitting in the   sun... relaxing.","""Captain's Holiday"""
286,PICARD,   That happens to be why I came to   Risa.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
287,VASH,   I'm sure you hated every minute   of it. That kind of vacation isn't   for a man like you. You need   excitement.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
288,PICARD,   Excitement? Sleeping in a damp   cave... chasing after something   we'll probably never find?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
289,VASH,"       You are enjoying yourself, aren't   you?","""Captain's Holiday"""
290,PICARD,   I suppose I am.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
291,VASH,       I just wanted to hear you say it.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
292,PICARD,   Good. Now go to sleep.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
293,VASH,   I'll never forget that look on   your face when you thought I was   offering you Jamaharon.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
294,PICARD,   That was a simple   misunderstanding.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
295,VASH,       You did seem a little disappointed   when I turned you down.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
296,PICARD,   You can be the most irritating   woman sometimes.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
297,VASH,"       You're kind of prickly yourself.       Don't you see, we're a lot alike.   That's probably why we get along   so well.","""Captain's Holiday"""
298,PICARD,   You call this getting along?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
299,VASH,   All right. We don't get along.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
300,VASH,       But you do admit we're attracted   to one another.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
301,PICARD,   Do I?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
302,VASH,"   If you want to pretend otherwise,   that's fine with me, but...","""Captain's Holiday"""
303,VASH,   You still think I'm trouble?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
304,PICARD,   I'm sure of it.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
305,DISSOLVE TO:,,"""Captain's Holiday"""
306,VASH,   This is it. We've reached the   end of our journey.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
307,PICARD,   Do you have an exact location?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
308,VASH,       Six meters in from the large   outcropping.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
309,PICARD,   That should put it right about   here.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
310,PICARD,   Is something wrong?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
311,VASH,   I can't get a reading. There must   be Starithium ore in these rocks.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
312,PICARD,   That leaves us but one   alternative.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
313,PICARD,   Shall we?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
314,VASH,    (wielding her shovel;     help)   Picard!,"""Captain's Holiday"""
315,PICARD,"    (seeing it's the     Vorgons)   A bit early, aren't you?","""Captain's Holiday"""
316,AJUR,"   We are here to witness a great   moment, Picard.","""Captain's Holiday"""
317,VASH,   Who the hell are they?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
318,PICARD,   They're security officers from   the twenty-seventh century.   They're here to take back the   Uthat.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
319,VASH,   You knew about this and didn't   tell me?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
320,PICARD,"   My apologies Vash... But if I   had told you, would you have   brought me here?","""Captain's Holiday"""
321,VASH,   Probably not.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
322,PICARD,   My point exactly.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
323,SOVAK ,   So the betrayer is herself   betrayed.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
324,SOVAK,       You've put together quite a little   team.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
325,AJUR,   You must not interrupt Captain   Picard...,"""Captain's Holiday"""
326,SOVAK,   Quiet. Move back with the   others.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
327,PICARD,       How did you get here?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
328,SOVAK,       I found the disc in her room.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
329,VASH,   That's impossible. I made a copy   as a precaution. But I burned   it before we left.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
330,SOVAK,"   Only the outer casing was   incinerated. Now, I had no   intention of interrupting you.   Please...       Continue digging.","""Captain's Holiday"""
331,SOVAK,"   No one told you to stop digging,   human.","""Captain's Holiday"""
332,PICARD,   I see no reason to continue.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
333,SOVAK,   You will do as I say. Now pick   up that shovel!,"""Captain's Holiday"""
334,PICARD,"   Look around Sovak, by now it must   be obvious even to you... the   Uthat is not here.","""Captain's Holiday"""
335,SOVAK,   Is this some pathetic attempt at   trickery? Of course it's here.   We simply haven't found it yet.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
336,VASH,   Are you saying the professor's   findings were wrong?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
337,PICARD,   It would appear so.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
338,VASH,       But how could that be? His   evidence was overwhelming.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
339,SOVAK,   Enough with this foolishness.       Can't you see he's trying to   deceive us?       Return to work this instant!,"""Captain's Holiday"""
340,VASH,"   I'm afraid he's right, Sovak.   According to the disc we should   have reached it hours ago.","""Captain's Holiday"""
341,SOVAK,       Lies! Treachery! This cannot   be happening. Not another   failure. Not after having come   so close.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
342,AJUR,   It is most puzzling.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
343,PICARD,"       It's over, Sovak.","""Captain's Holiday"""
344,SOVAK,"   No, I will not be cheated out of   my prize.       Tell him. Tell him the   professor's research is   irrefutable.","""Captain's Holiday"""
345,VASH,       I... I don't know anymore...,"""Captain's Holiday"""
346,SOVAK,   Then step aside...,"""Captain's Holiday"""
347,SOVAK,       The Uthat is here... somewhere...   Just waiting to be found... It   can't hide from me forever.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
348,VASH,   Five years of my life... wasted.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
349,PICARD,"   There are other treasures to be   found, Vash.","""Captain's Holiday"""
350,VASH,   Not like the Uthat.       I hope you won't mind... but I   need to be alone for awhile.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
351,PICARD,   I quite understand.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
352,RIKER ,   Enterprise to Picard.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
353,PICARD,   Picard here.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
354,INTERCUT TO:,,"""Captain's Holiday"""
355,RIKER,"   I hope we're not interrupting   anything important, Captain. I   just wanted to inform you that   we have achieved orbit around Risa   and are ready to beam you up at   your convenience.","""Captain's Holiday"""

359,RIKER,"   Yes, sir.","""Captain's Holiday"""
360,PICARD,   Picard out.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
361,END INTERCUT.,,"""Captain's Holiday"""
362,PICARD ,   Leaving so soon?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
363,VASH,   Jean-Luc -- I was just about to   come say good-bye.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
364,PICARD,"   Well then, I've saved you the   bother.","""Captain's Holiday"""
365,VASH,   I want to put all this behind me   as soon as possible. You   understand.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
366,PICARD,"   Of course. However, there is one   last thing you can do for me.","""Captain's Holiday"""
367,VASH,   Anything.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
368,PICARD,   Show me where you've hidden the   Tox Uthat.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
369,VASH,"   That's not funny, Jean-Luc.","""Captain's Holiday"""
370,PICARD,"   You never intended to burn that   second disc. If you had, you   wouldn't have been so careless   as to allow Sovak to salvage any   of it. You wanted him to follow   us so he could see for himself   that the Uthat wasn't at the cave   site. It was the only way to   convince him your quest had been   futile.","""Captain's Holiday"""
371,VASH,   But how could I have known the   Uthat wasn't there?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
372,PICARD,   Because you had gone there once   before. Probably the moment you   arrived on the planet. That's   when you found it.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
373,VASH,"       You're a man of many talents,   Jean-Luc.","""Captain's Holiday"""
374,VASH,   Open it.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
375,VASH,       A piece of the future.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
376,PICARD,   A very dangerous piece. Were you   really going to give it to the   Daystom Institute?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
377,VASH,"   Well, maybe not give it.       Five years is a huge investment,   Jean-Luc. I deserve to make a   reasonable profit.","""Captain's Holiday"""
378,AJUR,   Congratulations Picard. We knew   you would not fail us.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
379,VASH,   You're not going to just hand   it over are you?       You didn't trust me... what makes   you think you can trust them?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
380,PICARD,   I assume the Vorgons have proof   to back up their claims.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
381,BORATUS,   Our being here is proof enough.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
382,VASH,"   Wait a second, Vorgons?     ","""Captain's Holiday"""
383,,,"""Captain's Holiday"""
384,VASH ,"   According to the professor's   notes, it was two Vorgons... a   male and a female... who tried   to steal the Uthat in the first   place. For all we know it could   be them.","""Captain's Holiday"""
385,PICARD,   You're going to have to prove   you are who you say you are.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
386,AJUR,"   As you yourself said, the Uthat   belongs to the future.","""Captain's Holiday"""
387,PICARD,   But not necessarily to you.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
388,BORATUS,"   You will return what is ours,   Picard.","""Captain's Holiday"""
389,VASH,   No!,"""Captain's Holiday"""
390,PICARD,   Enterprise... Code Fourteen...   Lock on present coordinates...   three second delay... Mark!,"""Captain's Holiday"""
391,PICARD,   Are you all right?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
392,PICARD,       Go. Return to your own time.   There's nothing for you here.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
393,BORATUS,   History recorded that you   destroyed the Uthat.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
394,AJUR,"   You have fulfilled your destiny   all too well, Picard.","""Captain's Holiday"""
395,VASH,   I don't suppose there are any   openings for an archaeologist   aboard the Enterprise.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
396,PICARD,       Somehow I doubt you'd find life   aboard a starship suitable to your   taste.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
397,VASH,   Probably not. I could never   tolerate all that discipline.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
398,PICARD,   What are your plans?,"""Captain's Holiday"""
399,VASH,   I thought I'd explore the ruins   on Sarthong Five. No telling what   I might find there.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
400,PICARD,   But the Sarthongians deal harshly   with trespassers.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
401,VASH,"   Why Jean-Luc, you really do care   about me.","""Captain's Holiday"""
402,PICARD,   You will try and stay out of   trouble.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
403,VASH,   I always try.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
404,VASH,   I wish we had more time together.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
405,PICARD,"       Perhaps we do.    (off her questioning     look)   The Vorgons are time travelers.   Now that they know where and when   the Uthat can be found, they may   very well come back and try for   it again.","""Captain's Holiday"""
406,VASH,   So we may be doing this all over   again.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
407,VASH,   Good-bye Jean-Luc.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
408,PICARD,   Picard to Transporter Room. One   to beam up.,"""Captain's Holiday"""

410,PICARD,"   Thank you, Commander. Status   report.","""Captain's Holiday"""
411,RIKER,   All went well on Starbase twelve.   I think you'll find the ship to   be in splendid condition.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
412,PICARD,   I'll present my compliments to   the crew. Oh yes... and Number   One... about that Horga'hn you   requested.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
413,RIKER,"       Yes, sir...","""Captain's Holiday"""
414,PICARD,   We need to have a little chat   about that.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
415,TROI,"   Was it a relaxing trip, Captain?","""Captain's Holiday"""
416,RIKER,       I knew he'd have a great time.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
417,COMPUTER ,   Welcome to Risa. All that is ours   is yours.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
418,AJUR,   We are looking for the lodging   chamber of Captain Jean-Luc   Picard.,"""Captain's Holiday"""
