21,SISKO,        One of our listening posts in the    Gamma Quadrant picked this up a    few minutes ago.,3    INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine

28,KIRA,   Bajoran Intelligence has had    plenty of experience breaking    Cardassian codes. Maybe we should    send it to them.,3    INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine

35,ZIYAL,   How did it go?,5    INT. REPLIMAT,REPLIMAT,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
36,GARAK,   I'm afraid I disappointed them.    I think they were hoping that    message they picked up would    contain the key to defeating the    Dominion. You should've seen the    looks on their faces when I told    them it was a five-year old    planetary survey report.,5    INT. REPLIMAT,REPLIMAT,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
37,BASHIR,       A planetary survey report.,5    INT. REPLIMAT,REPLIMAT,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
38,GARAK,   That's the look exactly.,5    INT. REPLIMAT,REPLIMAT,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
39,BASHIR,"   I'd've thought you'd be a little    disappointed, too.    (off Garak's questioning    look)   It could have been sent by   survivors from the Cardassian   fleet that was lost in the Gamma   Quadrant.",5    INT. REPLIMAT,REPLIMAT,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine

42,GARAK,"       There comes a time when you have    to face reality, my dear. Those    people are gone and they're never    coming back.       Well, my young friends, I could    sit here and chat all day, but I    have dresses to make, pants to    mend... It's a full life, if a    trifle... banal.",5    INT.

48,GARAK,"   Doctor, I really must remember to    stop underestimating you. How did    you know?",10   INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
49,BASHIR,   You mean that you were lying about    the contents of the message?       You said you'd given up on finding    Cardassian survivors in the Gamma    Quadrant. But Ziyal's right.    You're not the giving up sort.,10   INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
50,GARAK,"   Very good, doctor. You've come a    long way from the naive young man    I met five years ago. You've    become distrustful and suspicious.    It suits you.",10   INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
51,BASHIR,   I had a good teacher.       what did the message really say?,10   INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
52,GARAK,   It was a call for help. From    Enabran Tain.,10   INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
53,BASHIR,   Tain? But you told me you saw the    Dominion blow up his ship.,10   INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
54,GARAK,"   I did. But Enabran Tain was the    head of the Obsidian order for    twenty years. If he survived    that, he can survive anything.",10   INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
55,BASHIR,   You don't owe Tain anything. He    had you exiled from Cardassia.,10   INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
56,GARAK,"   Yes, but aside from that, we were    very close. He was... my mentor.    And I'm not going to turn my back    on him.       If it'll make you feel better,    come with me. All you have to do    is make up some excuse for taking    the runabout and we could leave    immediately.",10   INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
57,BASHIR,"   Let me get this straight. You're    asking me to lie to my commanding    officer, violate Starfleet    regulations, and go off with you    on a mission that will probably    get us both killed?",10   INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
58,GARAK,       I'm ready when you are.,10   INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine

60,SISKO,   How do you know the message isn't    a fake? That it was really sent    by Tain?,11   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
61,GARAK,   The code sequence was personally    designed by Tain and myself. No    one else knows it. Somehow he got    that message out. Now I have to    follow it back to its source.,11   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
62,SISKO,   Did the message contain any    coordinates?,11   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
63,GARAK,"   No. Most of it was identification    code. The rest was just one   word... ""alive,"" repeated over    and over again. So it should be    easy enough to triangulate the source.       Captain, Tain might not be alone.    There could be others. Troops    from the Cardassian/Romulan fleet,    survivors from the Dominion attack    on New Bajor, even crewmen from    the Federation ships that've    disappeared in the Gamma Quadrant.   This is a mission of mercy. You    can't ignore it.",11   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
64,SISKO,   I'm still not totally convinced    the message is genuine.       But I suppose there's only one way    to find out.,11   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
65,BASHIR,"   Captain, you can't let him go.    It is too dangerous.",11   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
66,GARAK,"   Your concern is touching, Doctor.    But I assure you, I can take care    of myself.",11   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
67,SISKO,   Maybe you can. But you're still    not going alone.,11   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
68,GARAK,"   Doctor, I think you've just    volunteered.",11   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine

70,DAX,   I don't know what makes me more    angry... that you agreed to go    into the Gamma Quadrant with    Garak... or that I had to find it    out from Sisko.,13   INT. DEFIANT - WORF'S QUARTERS,DEFIANT,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine

74,DAX,"   So in other words, you were afraid    I'd make a scene. That I'd    embarrass you. Maybe even cry.",13   INT. DEFIANT - WORF'S QUARTERS,DEFIANT,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine

82,DAX,   What? Something wrong?,13   INT. DEFIANT - WORF'S QUARTERS,DEFIANT,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
83,WORF,   You have a tendency to misplace    things.,13   INT. DEFIANT - WORF'S QUARTERS,DEFIANT,INT.,,1996-11-18,Deep Space Nine
