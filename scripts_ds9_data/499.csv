1,O'BRIEN,   Maybe the meeting with Starfleet    Command took longer than they    thought it would.,11A  INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
2,KIRA,   Then why haven't Sisko or Dax    contacted us?,11A  INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine

4,WORF,   I never should've let them leave    in a runabout. I should've    insisted they take the Defiant.,11A  INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
5,KIRA,   You did. But the captain's orders    were clear.,11A  INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine

8,WORF,   It would take a fleet of Klingon    ships to breach the station's    defenses. I say we take the    Defiant and go looking for the    captain.,11A  INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine

33,QUARK,"   Do you think any of these people    looked happy when they walked in    here? How could they? There's a    war going on.

41,ODO,"   Soothing, isn't it? You know,    before I became a Solid, I never    heard that. I didn't have a sense    of taste so I never paid much    attention to food, or drink.

45,ODO,"   You know, at first, I found the    whole process of ingestion...    disgusting. But now that I've    gotten used to it, I find eating    and drinking to be quite    comforting. It's one of the few    things you...       ... we humanoids have control over.",16   INT. QUARK'S SECOND LEVEL,QUARK'S SECOND LEVEL,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
46,SISKO,   Not necessarily. There's always    the temptation to eat too much...    to drink too much...,16   INT. QUARK'S SECOND LEVEL,QUARK'S SECOND LEVEL,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine

48,SISKO,   I might be able to do something    about that. Starfleet has ordered    us to try to expose the Gowron    changeling. I want you to come    with us.,16   INT. QUARK'S SECOND LEVEL,QUARK'S SECOND LEVEL,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
49,ODO,   Maybe it would be better for you    to take Deputy Yndar. There's    nothing I can do that he can't.,16   INT. QUARK'S SECOND LEVEL,QUARK'S SECOND LEVEL,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
50,SISKO,   I don't need Yndar. I need you.     ODO   What you need is someone who can    turn into Gowron's pet targ. And    I can't do that anymore.,16   INT. QUARK'S SECOND LEVEL,QUARK'S SECOND LEVEL,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine

52,SISKO,   What I need is my chief of    security.       There's a staff meeting at sixteen    hundred hours. I expect you to be    there.,16   INT. QUARK'S SECOND LEVEL,QUARK'S SECOND LEVEL,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
53,SISKO,"   According to Starfleet    intelligence, Chancellor Gowron    has relocated Klingon military    headquarters to Ty'Gokor.",18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
54,WORF,   That will make our job more    difficult. Ty'Gokor is located in    an asteroid field deep in Klingon    Space. It is probably the most    heavily fortified installation in    the Empire.,18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
55,SISKO,       There're at least thirty warships    stationed there at any given time    and the entire asteroid field is    protected by a tachyon detection    grid.,18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
56,O'BRIEN,   Which means there's no way to get    a cloaked ship within transporter    range.,18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
57,WORF,"   Even if we do find a way inside,    getting close to Gowron will not    be easy. He is guarded around the    clock by his personal security    force, the Yan-Isleth.",18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
58,DAX,       The Brotherhood of the Sword.,18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
59,KIRA,"   Look, I don't want to sound    negative, but even if you get to    Gowron, how can you prove to the    Klingons he's a changeling?",18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
60,ODO,   I doubt he'll stand still and let    us take a blood sample.,18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
61,BASHIR,"   The Klingons are obsessive about    blood screenings. If he's lasted    this long, the changeling    impersonating Gowron must've    already found a way around them.",18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
62,WORF,   There is one solution. We could    kill him.,18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
63,O'BRIEN,   Dead changelings do revert back to    their gelatinous state.,18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
64,SISKO,"   Our orders are to expose Gowron,    not assassinate him. Which is why    Starfleet has given us these.",18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
65,BASHIR,   Very impressive.       What are they?,18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
66,DAX,   They're modified polaron emitters.,18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
67,SISKO,   Starfleet Science thinks that    exposure to polaron radiation will    have a destabilizing effect on    changeling physiology.,18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
68,ODO,"   In other words, if you use these    on Gowron, and he is one of my    people, he won't be able to retain    his humanoid shape.",18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
69,SISKO,   That's the theory.,18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
70,DAX,"   The problem is, for it to work    properly, you have to activate all    four emitters at once.",18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
71,O'BRIEN,   I hate prototypes.,18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
72,DAX,"   Plus, too much polaron radiaton    can be fatal. Which means we can    only expose a person once. Any    more than that and, changeling or    not, they'll die of radiation    poisoning.",18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
73,SISKO,"   The plan is to smuggle these into    Ty'Gokor. Once they're set up,    they can cover about twelve    thousand cubic meters.",18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
74,O'BRIEN,"   So let me get this straight. All    we have to do is get past an enemy    fleet, avoid a tachyon detection    grid, beam into the middle of    Klingon headquarters and avoid    the Brotherhood of the Sword long    enough to set these things up and    activate them in front of Gowron.",18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
75,WORF,"   If we succeed, there will be many    songs sung in our honor.",18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
76,O'BRIEN,   I just hope we're around to hear    them.,18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
77,KIRA,   The first problem is how to get    you safely to Ty'Gokor.,18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
78,SISKO,   That's one I think I can solve.,18   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine

82,KIRA,   I can answer that.,23A  INT. DOCKING RING CORRIDOR,DOCKING RING CORRIDOR,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
83,DUKAT,"   Major, I must say, I'm shocked.    You used my daughter to lure me    here. You're asking me to risk my    ship on some fool's errand into    the Klingon Empire. And you're    pregnant.

88,KIRA,   It might not be as hopeless as you    think.,25   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
89,DUKAT,   How can Sisko be so deluded to    think he and four of his crewmen    can infiltrate Klingon military    headquarters? They'll be caught    in a heartbeat.,25   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine

100,DAMAR,"   Personally, I think we'd be better    off launching an orbital assault    on Gowron's Command Center.

103,O'BRIEN,   Shelling Ty'Gokor won't get the    job done. You'd be lucky to    launch one torpedo before they    shot you down. And even a dozen    wouldn't penetrate the shielding    around the command center.,30   INT. DUKAT'S BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE,DUKAT'S BIRD OF PREY,INT.,,1996-07-03,Deep Space Nine
