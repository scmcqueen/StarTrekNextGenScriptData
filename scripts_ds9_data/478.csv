0,QUARK,   It's a trick.,1    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
1,BASHIR,   Of course it's a trick. But do    you know how she did it?,1    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
2,QUARK,   She probably had the egg beamed    directly into her mouth from one    of the transporters.,1    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
3,DAX,"   Actually, one of my previous hosts    used to dabble in sleight of hand.",1    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
4,BASHIR,"   Tobin, by any chance?",1    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
5,DAX,   That's right.,1    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
6,BASHIR,"   He sounds like the type.    Painfully shy, introverted, a    certain lack of confidence... just    the kind of person who would begin    looking for ways to dazzle people    with his ""magical"" abilities.",1    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
7,QUARK,"    (still thinking about     the trick)    She swallowed the egg before she    came into the bar. Then she    regurgitated it on cue. Quite    disgusting, actually.",1    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
8,DAX,   Wrong again.,1    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
9,SISKO,"   Sisko to Dax. I'd like to see you    in my office, commander.",1    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
10,DAX,"        On my way, Benjamin.        Don't worry, Quark. I'm sure    you'll figure it out eventually.",1    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
11,DAX,        Hmm... no wonder you can't figure    it out.,1    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
12,QUARK,        What?,1    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
13,DAX,   Your head's full of latinum.,1    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine

15,SISKO,   Have a seat.,2    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
16,SISKO,        A Trill science team is on its way    to the station. They're coming to    conduct field tests on an    experimental technique for    creating artificial wormholes.,2    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
17,DAX,   Sounds interesting.,2    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
18,SISKO,   It's an important project and I've    agreed to let them use the Defiant    for their experiments.        But I thought you should know that    the leader of the Trill science    team... is Doctor Lenara Kahn.,2    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
19,DAX,   Kahn? Lenara... Kahn?,2    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
20,SISKO,   That's right.        You have about three months worth    of leave accumulated. Why don't    you take some of it? We can get    along without you for a while.,2    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
21,DAX,        Am I that dispensable around here?,2    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
22,SISKO,        We won't even notice you're gone.,2    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
23,DAX,   No. I'll stay.  I can handle it.,2    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
24,SISKO,   You sure?,2    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
25,DAX,   I'm sure. I've never let my past    lives interfere with my job and    I'm not going to start now. I'll    be fine.,2    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
26,SISKO,   Okay.,2    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
27,DAX,   But thanks for giving me the    option.,2    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
28,SISKO,   Any time... old man.,2    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
29,DAX,   They... just finished docking.,4    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
30,KIRA,   Something wrong?,4    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
31,DAX,   No.,4    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
32,PREN,   I'm Doctor Hanor Pren of the Trill    science ministry.,4    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
33,KIRA,"   I'm Major Kira Nerys, and I'd like    to welcome you to Deep Space Nine.    This is our strategic operations    officer, Commander Worf, and of    course our science officer,    Commander Dax.",4    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
34,PREN,"   Allow me to introduce our team    leader Doctor Lenara Kahn and her    brother Doctor Bejal Otner.    (introducing them to the    Trill)   Major Kira, Commander Worf, and   Commander Dax.",4    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
35,DAX,   It's been a long time.,4    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
36,LENARA,"   Yes, it has.",4    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
37,WORF,"   If you will come with me, I'll    show you to your quarters.",4    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
38,KIRA,   You know that woman?,4    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
39,DAX,"   Oh, I know her.       She used to be my wife.",4    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
40,QUARK,   So let me get this straight.    Dax's first host was named Lela.    Right?,5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
41,BASHIR,   I think so.,5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
42,KIRA,"   Lela Dax, that's right...",5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
43,QUARK,"   Then Lela dies and the Dax    symbiont goes to a man named...    Tobin. And after Tobin dies, then    it's on to Emony... then...       ... Torias.... Audrid...",5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
44,KIRA,"   No, no. Audrid, then Torias.",5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
45,QUARK,"   Sorry. Audrid, Torias, Joran,    Curzon... and then finally Jadzia.        And this Doctor Lenara Kahn person    was once married to... ?",5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
46,BASHIR,   Torias.        But of course she wasn't Lenara    in those days.,5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
47,QUARK,   I knew it couldn't be that simple.,5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
48,BASHIR,"   The Kahn symbiont that's now    joined to Lenara, used to be    joined to a woman named Nilani.    It was Nilani who married Torias    Dax.",5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
49,KIRA,   But Torias was killed in a shuttle    accident...,5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
50,BASHIR,"   And so Nilani became a widow.    Years later, when she died, the    Kahn symbiont was joined to    Lenara.",5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
51,QUARK,"   And now... Nilani is Lenara, and    Torias is Jadzia. So that makes    Lenara Jadzia's ex-wife.",5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
52,KIRA,"   It's a little more complicated    than that, Quark.",5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
53,QUARK,"   I'm sure it is. But to be honest,    I'm sorry I brought the whole    thing up. It's giving me a    headache.",5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
54,BASHIR,   Must be all that latinum rattling    around in there.,5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
55,BASHIR,   I was right. You really should    have that looked at.,5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
56,QUARK,       Get back to work.,5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
57,QUARK,       If you'll excuse me...,5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
58,KIRA,        Dax teach you that?,5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
59,BASHIR,        Next time I want to pull a rabbit    out of his ear.,5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
60,KIRA,"   One thing I don't understand is    why Dax and Lenara can't just...    pick up where they left off. I    mean, if they're still in love    with each other --",5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
61,BASHIR,"   Ah, but there's the rub. Even if    they do harbor feelings for each    other, it's strictly against the    rules of Trill society for them to    acknowledge it in any way.",5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
62,KIRA,"   The ""rules?""",5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
63,BASHIR,"   It's more of a... taboo, really.    Having a relationship with a lover    from a past life is called,    ""reassociation,"" and the Trill    feel very strongly that it's...    unnatural.",5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
64,KIRA,   Unnatural? How can it be    unnatural for a married couple to    resume their marriage?,5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
65,BASHIR,"   The whole point of joining is to    allow the symbiont to accumulate    experiences over the span of many    lifetimes. But in order to move    on from host to host, the symbiont    has to let go of the past... let    go of parents, children, siblings,    even spouses.",5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
66,KIRA,"   I don't understand how two people    who've fallen in love, and made a    life together, can be forced to   just... walk away from each other    because of some... taboo.         There must be some Trill that    ""reassociate"" with people from    their past.",5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
67,BASHIR,   I asked Dax the same question.    And it seems there have been a few    cases...,5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
68,KIRA,   And what happened?,5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
69,BASHIR,        They were exiled from the Trill    homeworld.,5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
70,KIRA,   That would mean their symbionts    would never be joined to new    hosts.,5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
71,BASHIR,"   Exactly. When the hosts die, the    symbionts would die with them.         So you see, however Dax may feel    about Lenara, she's not going to    risk that. To a joined Trill,    nothing is more important than    protecting the life of the    symbiont. Nothing.",5    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
72,DAX,   Come in.,8    INT. DAX'S QUARTERS,DAX'S QUARTERS,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
73,SISKO,   I had a feeling you weren't going    to be ready. I don't think Curzon    was ever on time in his life. He    was even late for his hundredth    birthday party as I recall.,8    INT. DAX'S QUARTERS,DAX'S QUARTERS,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine

78,DAX,   You know me. I hate to miss a    party.,8    INT. DAX'S QUARTERS,DAX'S QUARTERS,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine

85,WORF,   I am... looking forward to it.,9    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
86,LENARA,        I think Mister Worf is less than    enthusiastic about commanding a    research mission. It's not    exactly what every Klingon dreams    about.,9    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine

93,DAX,   Unnecessary?,9    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine

104,DAX,   Quite an audience.,9    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
105,LENARA,   Seems a shame to disappoint them.    We should probably do something.,9    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
106,DAX,   We could get into a screaming    match... start throwing things at    each other...,9    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine

124,PREN,   We'll also need to download our     parameters for the matrix into one     of your computers.,14   INT. DEFIANT - ENGINE ROOM,DEFIANT,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
125,DAX,   We'd better use the main computer.     I don't think the engineering     computer can handle it.,14   INT. DEFIANT - ENGINE ROOM,DEFIANT,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
126,O'BRIEN,   I agree.,14   INT. DEFIANT - ENGINE ROOM,DEFIANT,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine

131,PREN,"        Well, that explains the seven    percent falloff in AFR ratios I    keep seeing.        There must be a problem in the    diagnostic sub-routines.

134,LENARA,   Now I'm getting a dropoff in the    triple-R output. We might have a    bigger problem than the diagnostic    subroutines.,15   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE ,DEFIANT,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
135,DAX,   Don't panic yet. It could just be    a transtater failure. Happens all    the time.,15   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE ,DEFIANT,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
136,LENARA,       I wasn't panicking.,15   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE ,DEFIANT,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine

139,LENARA,        It's just that... you always used    to -- I mean Torias always used to    tell Nilani that she was panicking    about things... making a big fuss    over nothing.,15   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE ,DEFIANT,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
140,DAX,"   Well... Torias could be    insensitive at times...        But... you have to admit, Nilani    did do her share of overreacting.",15   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE ,DEFIANT,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
141,LENARA,        That's because you were a pilot    and it made me nervous -- made her    nervous... Torias being a pilot    made Nilani nervous.,15   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE ,DEFIANT,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine

143,DAX,   I know what you mean.,15   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE ,DEFIANT,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
144,LENARA,        Probably another reason why we're    not supposed to spend much time    together... we'd just get lost in    the past.,15   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE ,DEFIANT,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine

146,LENARA,   Okay.,15   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE ,DEFIANT,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
147,DAX,        Nilani wasn't panicking the day    before Torias died.,15   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE ,DEFIANT,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
148,LENARA,   No?,15   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE ,DEFIANT,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
149,DAX,   No. Torias should've listened to    her. The shuttle wasn't ready for    a full impulse test... but Torias    had to do it anyway... and he was    wrong.        And whatever part of me is still    Torias... is very sorry... and    wishes he'd listened to you.,15   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE ,DEFIANT,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine

175,LENARA,   Curzon was certainly... different    from most joined Trills.,21   INT. QUARK'S - SECOND LEVEL,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
176,DAX,   He liked to do things his own way.    He used to say that there was an    exception to every rule... and he    usually went out of his way to    find it.,21   INT. QUARK'S - SECOND LEVEL,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
177,LENARA,   In a way I'm glad I never met him.         We probably wouldn't have liked    each other very much.,21   INT. QUARK'S - SECOND LEVEL,QUARK'S,INT.,,1995-08-30,Deep Space Nine
