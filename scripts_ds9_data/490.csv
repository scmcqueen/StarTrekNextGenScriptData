337,CH'POK,       Yes.,65   INT. WARDROOM ,WARDROOM ,INT.,"""Rules of Engagement""",1996-01-16,Deep Space Nine
338,WORF,   Captain.,67   INT. DEFIANT - WORF'S QUARTERS,DEFIANT,INT.,"""Rules of Engagement""",1996-01-16,Deep Space Nine
339,SISKO,   I thought you should know that   O'Brien and Bashir are throwing   you a party at Quark's. It looks   like quite a bash.,67   INT. DEFIANT - WORF'S QUARTERS,DEFIANT,INT.,"""Rules of Engagement""",1996-01-16,Deep Space Nine
340,WORF,   I... am aware of it.,67   INT. DEFIANT - WORF'S QUARTERS,DEFIANT,INT.,"""Rules of Engagement""",1996-01-16,Deep Space Nine
341,WORF,   Ch'Pok was right. I... did have   something to prove when I took   command of the convoy.,67   INT. DEFIANT - WORF'S QUARTERS,DEFIANT,INT.,"""Rules of Engagement""",1996-01-16,Deep Space Nine
342,WORF,       I didn't realize it until I stood   there looking down at him... the   blood trickling from his face.   But in that moment... I remember   thinking... Finally. He had   given me what I really wanted...   a reason to attack him.,67   INT. DEFIANT - WORF'S QUARTERS,DEFIANT,INT.,"""Rules of Engagement""",1996-01-16,Deep Space Nine
343,WORF,   And it was the same feeling I had   when the Klingon ships first   attacked... finally. A chance   for vengeance.       I should not have accepted the   mission.,67   INT. DEFIANT - WORF'S QUARTERS,DEFIANT,INT.,"""Rules of Engagement""",1996-01-16,Deep Space Nine
344,SISKO,   I'm glad you realize that.       That was your first mistake. What   was your second?,67   INT. DEFIANT - WORF'S QUARTERS,DEFIANT,INT.,"""Rules of Engagement""",1996-01-16,Deep Space Nine
345,WORF,   When the ship decloaked... I   should have checked the target   before I fired.,67   INT. DEFIANT - WORF'S QUARTERS,DEFIANT,INT.,"""Rules of Engagement""",1996-01-16,Deep Space Nine
346,SISKO,"       You're damn right, you should've   checked. You knew there were   civilian ships in the area, yet   you fired at something you hadn't   identified!",67   INT. DEFIANT - WORF'S QUARTERS,DEFIANT,INT.,"""Rules of Engagement""",1996-01-16,Deep Space Nine
347,SISKO,"       You made a... military decision to   protect your ship and crew. But   you're a Starfleet officer, Worf.   We don't put civilians at risk --   or even potentially at risk -- to   save ourselves. Sometimes that   means we lose a battle... and   sometimes we lose our lives. But   if you can't make that choice, you   can't wear that uniform.",67   INT. DEFIANT - WORF'S QUARTERS,DEFIANT,INT.,"""Rules of Engagement""",1996-01-16,Deep Space Nine
348,WORF,"   Yes, sir.",67   INT. DEFIANT - WORF'S QUARTERS,DEFIANT,INT.,"""Rules of Engagement""",1996-01-16,Deep Space Nine
349,SISKO,   Now all that being true... the   reality is... no harm was done.   There are no dead children on your   conscience. You got lucky.,67   INT. DEFIANT - WORF'S QUARTERS,DEFIANT,INT.,"""Rules of Engagement""",1996-01-16,Deep Space Nine
350,WORF,   I do not... feel lucky.,67   INT. DEFIANT - WORF'S QUARTERS,DEFIANT,INT.,"""Rules of Engagement""",1996-01-16,Deep Space Nine
351,SISKO,"   And that's why despite everything   that's happened... you're going to   make a helluva captain someday.   Now, let's go... they're all    waiting.       Look, this party isn't for you as   much as it is for them. Things   got a little tense there for a   while, and they need a release, a   chance to celebrate.",67   INT. DEFIANT - WORF'S QUARTERS,DEFIANT,INT.,"""Rules of Engagement""",1996-01-16,Deep Space Nine
352,WORF,   But I do not feel like   celebrating.,67   INT. DEFIANT - WORF'S QUARTERS,DEFIANT,INT.,"""Rules of Engagement""",1996-01-16,Deep Space Nine
353,SISKO,"   Maybe not. But part of being a   captain is knowing when to smile   and make the troops happy. Even   when it's the last thing in the   world you want to do. Because   they're your troops, and you have   to take care of them.",67   INT. DEFIANT - WORF'S QUARTERS,DEFIANT,INT.,"""Rules of Engagement""",1996-01-16,Deep Space Nine
354,WORF,   Life is a great deal more   complicated in this red uniform.,67   INT. DEFIANT - WORF'S QUARTERS,DEFIANT,INT.,"""Rules of Engagement""",1996-01-16,Deep Space Nine
355,SISKO,       Just wait until you get four pips   on that collar. You'll wish you'd   gone into botany.,67   INT. DEFIANT - WORF'S QUARTERS,DEFIANT,INT.,"""Rules of Engagement""",1996-01-16,Deep Space Nine
