39,BASHIR,   The pain you experienced appears to    be a muscle spasm caused by a sudden    decrease in your serum calcium levels --    it's a typical side effect of    radiation poisoning.,12   INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,Visionary,1995-01-03,Deep Space Nine,463.txt

53,KIRA,   I can arrange that.,13   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,Visionary,1995-01-03,Deep Space Nine,463.txt
54,RUWON,       The Dominion represents one of the    greatest threats to the Alpha Quadrant    in the last century.  We need more    information on their military    capabilities.  How many ships do    they have?  Where are they deployed?     What are their plans for the future?     Are they planning an attack?,13   INT.

59,KIRA,   Yes...,13   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,Visionary,1995-01-03,Deep Space Nine,463.txt

62,RUWON,   I fail to see the distinction.,13   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,Visionary,1995-01-03,Deep Space Nine,463.txt
63,KIRA,   Odo made a conscious choice to stay    here with us.  He has no loyalty to    the Dominion and he has no information    about their plans.,13   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,Visionary,1995-01-03,Deep Space Nine,463.txt

67,KARINA,   We shouldn't have to remind you of    the importance both our governments    place on continuing to carry out    this agreement.  It's the first treaty    between Romulus and the Federation    in many years.,13   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,Visionary,1995-01-03,Deep Space Nine,463.txt
68,SISKO,   I'm aware of that... and I'm willing    to cooperate with you in any way    that I can.,13   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,Visionary,1995-01-03,Deep Space Nine,463.txt

71,SISKO,   I'll have to clear that with    Starfleet.,13   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,Visionary,1995-01-03,Deep Space Nine,463.txt

77,DAX,   I went over the internal sensor logs    and I did find evidence of a minor    temporal disturbance in Quark's...    and then another one later on the    Promenade.

80,DAX,   Not yet.  I want to go over the    medical scans Julian took of you    earlier.  That dose of ionizing    radiation you received may have    something to do with it.,20   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,Visionary,1995-01-03,Deep Space Nine,463.txt

86,O'BRIEN,   Can you repair it?,25   INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,Visionary,1995-01-03,Deep Space Nine,463.txt
87,BASHIR,"   Yes.  But the effect is cumulative.     If you keep time shifting, there may    come a point where the damage becomes    irreparable.  Eventually, it might    even kill you.",25   INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,Visionary,1995-01-03,Deep Space Nine,463.txt

90,BASHIR,"   In the meantime, I'm also working on    a way to purge your system of the    residual radio-isotopes in case it's    related to the timeshifting.

98,KIRA,   The Romulans want to debrief everyone    who was on the Defiant when it was    captured by the Founders.  They're    also still not happy with the sensor    information collected by the Defiant.     So they want unrestricted access to    the Defiant.

111,KIRA,"       When the Defiant was attacked, Odo    and I were trapped belowdecks.     There was a hand-to-hand fight in    the corridors.  I was wounded and I    lost consciousness.

123,KARINA,   You are the only member of the    Defiant's crew who was not taken    prisoner.  Why?  Did the Founders    believe Odo would react badly if you    were harmed?

167,DAX,   I've been scanning the area around    the station out to a radius of two    kilometers.
