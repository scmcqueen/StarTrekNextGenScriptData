382,KASIDY,   Sounds good to me. But let's talk   about it over dinner.       You can cook.,46   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,STAR TREK:  DEEP SPACE NINE,1998-03-27,Deep Space Nine,549.txt

I am not the    arrogant, self-absorbed, god-like    doctor that I appear to be on    occasion...        Isn't anyone going to object to    that statement?",46   INT.

389,BASHIR,"   Thank you, Miles Edward O'Brien.        I do have a heart. And I do care    for all of you... even if it    sometimes seems as though all I    care about is my work.

The war's changed us... made us    pull away from each other.        Lisa Cusak was my friend and now    she's dead. But you're my friends    too. And I want my friends in my    life. Because one day we may wake    up and discover that someone's    missing from this circle... and    on that day we'll mourn... but we    shouldn't have to mourn alone.
