57,NOG,"   It's my life's savings.

454,KIRA ,"       I'm sorry that it took so long for    me to tell you how I feel about you.     Maybe if I'd told you earlier, things    would've been different.",53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
455,KIRA,   What are you smiling about?,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
456,ODO,"    (still looking at the     phaser hits)   I think I've finally figured out    what's going on here.  This whole    situation hasn't seemed right since    the beginning.  There've been too    many coincidences, too many unanswered    questions.",53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
457,KIRA,   Are you still trying to prove this    is some kind of conspiracy?,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
458,ODO,   You said the Maquis was standing    about here when he fired at you?,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
459,KIRA,   That's right.,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
460,ODO,   How tall was he?  My height?,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
461,KIRA,   No.  Maybe a little shorter.,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
462,ODO,   Like this?,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
463,KIRA,   More or less.  Why does it matter    anyway?,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
464,ODO,"   It matters because from this position,    you're blocking those phaser hits.",53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
465,ODO,       There's no way someone standing here    could've hit those rocks without    hitting you first.,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
466,KIRA,   Maybe he was standing somewhere else.,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
467,ODO,   Maybe.  Or maybe you were lying to    me.  Which makes two times you've    lied to me today.,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
468,KIRA,   What are you talking about?,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
469,ODO,   You lied when you said you were shot    at by the Maquis.  And you lied when    you said you loved me.,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
470,ODO,"   I wish you did.  But you don't.       Remember Major, I pride myself on my    ability to observe human nature.     And I've watched you for the past    three years.  In all that time, I    never saw the slightest indication    that you had those kinds of feelings    for me.  You like me.  You think of    me as a close friend... but love?     I'm afraid not.",53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
471,KIRA,   Maybe I said I loved you because I    thought it'd make you feel better.     Because I thought it was what you    wanted to hear.,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
472,ODO,"   You're lying again.  The Kira I know    values our friendship far too much    to lie to me, even for the best of    reasons.",53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
473,KIRA,   Odo... I can explain...,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
474,ODO,   Good.  You can start by telling me    who you are and what you've done    with Kira.,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
475,FEMALE CHANGELING,"   Well done, Odo.  You really are quite    a skillful investigator.",53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
476,ODO,   And you're quite a skillful    changeling.,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
477,FEMALE CHANGELING,   You still have much to learn.,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
478,ODO,"   If you want to share your wisdom    with me, you can start by telling me    where Major Kira is.",53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
479,FEMALE CHANGELING,   Close by.,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
480,ODO,"   You were the fugitive we were chasing,    weren't you?",53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
481,FEMALE CHANGELING,   That's correct.,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
482,ODO,   How'd you get your hands on a Maquis    ship?,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
483,FEMALE CHANGELING,"   Now, Odo, you can't expect me to    give you all the answers.",53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
484,ODO,   But why did you lead us here?  And    why replace Kira?,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
485,FEMALE CHANGELING,   I needed to understand why you chose    to live with the Solids rather than    your own people.  I suspected it had    something to do with Major Kira.       And now I'm certain of it.,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
486,ODO,   So your plan was to let me think she    died.  You thought that would take    away my link to the Solids.,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
487,FEMALE CHANGELING,   And then you would return to us.,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
488,ODO,"   I assure you, nothing will ever make    me do that.",53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
489,FEMALE CHANGELING,   I wouldn't be so sure.,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
490,ODO,    (still aiming the     phaser)   Tell me where she is.,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
491,FEMALE CHANGELING,"   And if I don't, then what?  You'll    shoot me?       No changeling has ever harmed another.",53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
492,ODO,   There's a first time for everything.,53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
493,FEMALE CHANGELING,"       Major Kira is down that tunnel, two    hundred meters south of here.  Save    her if it suits you.       But it won't make any difference.     She's never going to love you.  How    could she?  You're a changeling.",53   INT. CAVERN CHAMBER,CAVERN CHAMBER,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
494,ODO,       Major.  Wake up.,57   INT. SIDE CORRIDOR,SIDE CORRIDOR,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine

496,ODO,   It's a long story.  Right now we    have to get you to the Mekong.,57   INT. SIDE CORRIDOR,SIDE CORRIDOR,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
497,KIRA,"   There's one thing I still don't    understand.  If that Founder wanted    to test your allegiance to the Solids,    why did she impersonate me?",59   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
498,ODO,   I suppose it's because you happened    to be with me in the runabout.  It    could just as easily have been    Commander Sisko... or Doctor Bashir.,59   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
499,KIRA,   So what finally made you realize the    truth?,59   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
500,ODO,   Eventually she made a mistake.  She    said something I know you would never    say.,59   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
501,KIRA,   And what was that?,59   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
502,ODO,   Just a slip of the tongue.  Nothing    important.,59   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1994-11-17,Deep Space Nine
