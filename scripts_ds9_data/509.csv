One night they had an ambush    planned, but they were a man    short. I volunteered to go, but    everyone said I was too young, too    small. But Lupaza stuck up for    me... said I had the heart of a    sinoraptor and this was no time to    be choosy.       Furel made some joke... I don't    remember what it was, but I    remember Lupaza hitting him -- she    always did that. They loved each    other in a way. But it was up to    Shakaar, and he stared at me for   a long time before deciding that    maybe I was big enough to carry    a phaser rifle after all.
