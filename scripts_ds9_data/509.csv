One night they had an ambush    planned, but they were a man    short. I volunteered to go, but    everyone said I was too young, too    small. But Lupaza stuck up for    me... said I had the heart of a    sinoraptor and this was no time to    be choosy.       Furel made some joke... I don't    remember what it was, but I    remember Lupaza hitting him -- she    always did that. They loved each    other in a way. But it was up to    Shakaar, and he stared at me for   a long time before deciding that    maybe I was big enough to carry    a phaser rifle after all.       So that night, we set up an ambush    on the ridgeline and waited. It    was cold and my hands kept    shaking.",37   INT. SURGERY,SURGERY,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1996-10-22,Deep Space Nine

And when the hatch opened and that   first Cardassian stepped out, I    just started firing. And I didn't    stop until I'd discharged the    entire power cell.       When it was over, I was so    relieved that I didn't let anyone    down that I was almost giddy.    Furel kept telling me to stop    grinning, that it made me look    even younger, but I couldn't help    it. I was one of them -- I was in    the Resistance.
