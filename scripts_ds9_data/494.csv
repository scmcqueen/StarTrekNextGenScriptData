12,SISKO,   Bye.,1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
13,EDDINGTON,   Good morning. This briefing will    contain information considered    extremely sensitive by Starfleet    Command.,3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
14,EDDINGTON ,"   Please do not share it with anyone    who doesn't have a level seven    security rating.       It seems that during their recent    invasion of Cardassia, the    Klingons inflicted far more damage    than we've been led to believe.    Two weeks ago, the civilian    government on Cardassia Prime    secretly contacted the Federation    Council and made an urgent request    for industrial replicators. And    that request... has been granted.",3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
15,DAX,   How many replicators are we    talking about?,3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
16,EDDINGTON,   Twelve -- all class four.,3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
17,KIRA,   The Federation's only given Bajor    two CFI replicators.,3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
18,EDDINGTON,"   With all due respect, Bajor is    just one planet. The Klingons    have destroyed the industrial base    of literally dozens of Cardassian    worlds. With twelve CFI    replicators, they can at least    start building new power plants    and factories.",3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
19,DAX,   Why all the secrecy?,3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
20,EDDINGTON,   Starfleet Intelligence believes    the Maquis may try to stop the    shipment or even seize the    replicators for themselves.,3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
21,SISKO,"   Makes sense. The Cardassian    military has been so busy fending    off the Klingons, they've    basically given the Maquis a free    hand in the Demilitarized Zone. ",3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
22,SISKO ,   The last thing the Maquis are    going to want to see is a shipment   of replicators on its way to   Cardassia.,3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
23,EDDINGTON,"    (continuing, indicating    map)   Yes, Sir. Intelligence also   reports that the Demilitarized   Zone between Cardassia and the   Federation has been a hotbed of   increasing terrorist activity for   the past month. We suspect the   Maquis have built several new   bases in the Badlands, and the   Cardassians in the DMZ are getting   worried.",3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
24,WORF,"   They should be. Without the    Cardassian military to stop them,    the Maquis have a perfect    opportunity to drive the    Cardassians out of the DMZ    permanently.",3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
25,SISKO,   I take it this shipment is going    to pass through Deep Space Nine?,3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
26,EDDINGTON,"   Yes, sir. In three days.",3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
27,SISKO,"   All right.       Let's tighten security on the    station. Step up random checks of    incoming and outgoing cargo for    weapons or explosives, more    deputies on the Promenade...    you know the drill.",3    INT.

28,ODO,   Understood.,3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
29,SISKO,"       Mister Worf, tomorrow I want you    to take the Defiant and patrol the    Badlands. Show the flag -- let    the Maquis know we're ready for    any trouble.",3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
30,WORF,"   Aye, sir.",3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
31,SISKO,       I want daily briefings on this    until the replicators are in    Cardassian hands.       Dismissed.,3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt

33,SISKO,   Something wrong?,3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
34,EDDINGTON,   Captain... it's come to our    attention that there may be a    Maquis smuggler here on the    station.,3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
35,SISKO,   Oh?,3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
36,ODO,   It's just a theory at this    point... and frankly our    suspicions are based on purely...    circumstantial evidence.,3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
37,SISKO,   Who is it?,3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
38,EDDINGTON,"   Again, we're still not certain...",3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt

40,SISKO,       Gentlemen?,3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
41,ODO,       Kasidy Yates.,3    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
42,SISKO,   Kasidy... ? Working for the    Maquis? That's impossible.,4    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
43,ODO,   I certainly hope so. Smuggling    with intent to supply a terrorist    organization is a serious offense.,4    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
44,SISKO,       Where's your evidence?,4    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
45,ODO,"   Five months ago, Captain Yates was    hired by the Bajorans to carry    cargo to their outlying colonies.    one of her regular runs is between    Bajor and the colony on Dreon    Seven. It's a twelve-hour run for    most ships, but she always takes    eighteen.       The six hour difference is just    enough time to allow her to make    a side trip into the Badlands,    rendezvous with a Maquis ship and    then continue on to the Dreon    System.",4    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
46,SISKO,   That's your evidence? She's    slow on one of her deliveries?,4    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
47,EDDINGTON,   There's more. Starfleet    Intelligence has infiltrated one    of the Maquis cells and obtained    a partial list of their contacts    in the Bajoran Sector. ,4    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
48,EDDINGTON ,"   They all had cover names, of    course, but one of their contacts    started living aboard Deep Space    Nine in the last six months.",4    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
49,ODO,   And Captain Yates has been living    aboard the station just under six    months.,4    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
50,SISKO,       That's damned slim evidence to    base an accusation on.,4    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
51,ODO,       We haven't made accusations... I    said we have suspicions.,4    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
52,SISKO,   Right. You did say that.,4    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
53,ODO,   Captain... I realize this is an    awkward situation for you. But if    I could step up my surveillance of    Captain Yates...,4    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
54,SISKO,   You've had her under surveillance?,4    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
55,EDDINGTON,   We've made... discreet    observations of her movements on    the station.,4    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
56,ODO,   But we'd like permission to    conduct a more thorough    investigation.,4    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
57,SISKO,   You mean install surveillance    equipment in her quarters...,4    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt

59,SISKO,"   She's a Federation citizen, Odo.    You can't just invade her privacy    based on your suspicions... you'd    need to show me some real evidence    before I'd authorize what you're    proposing.",4    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
60,EDDINGTON,"   If she's really a Maquis, then    she's no longer a Federation    citizen.",4    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
61,SISKO,   The answer is no.,4    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
62,EDDINGTON,"   Understood, sir.",4    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
63,SISKO,   Gentlemen...       Putting equipment in her quarters is    one thing... but her ship is a    different story. There are times    when we have to search vessels    docked at the station. If you can    find a reason...,4    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,For the Cause,1996-02-26,Deep Space Nine,494.txt
