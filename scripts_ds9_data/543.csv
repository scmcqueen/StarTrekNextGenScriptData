4,SISKO,"   I need to talk about this. I have    to justify what's happened... what    I've done... at least to myself.    I can't talk to anyone else... not    even Dax.

13,SISKO,   Just that they disappeared on    patrol near the Romulan Neutral    Zone. But I'll look into it.,2    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
14,DAX,        Don't bother. I'm sure it's the    same old story -- the Jem'Hadar    crossed over the Romulan border    and caught them off-guard. It's    only about the hundredth time it's    happened.,2    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
15,BASHIR,   I can't believe the Romulans are    allowing them to violate their    territory so brazenly. How do    they get away with it?,2    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
16,SISKO,"   The Romulans have a treaty of non-   aggression and friendship with the    Dominion.

19,BASHIR,"   What we need is to bring the    Romulans into the war on our side.    With the combined forces of the    Federation, the Klingons and the    Romulans we could finally go on the    offensive.",2    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
20,DAX,"   That's the last thing the Romulans    want. Think about it -- they're    in the perfect position. They get    to sit back and watch as their    biggest rivals slug it out in a    long, bloody war. No one's    threatening their interests. Why    should they risk their necks?

22,SISKO,   I was absolutely sure it was the    right decision -- that's the   frightening part -- how right it    seemed at the time.

28,DAX,   So they're crossing through my    backyard to give the Federation    a bloody nose. I can't say that    makes me very sad.,4    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt

31,SISKO,"   The Founders see it as their    sacred duty to bring order to the    galaxy. Their order.

36,DAX,"   That's your problem. But before    I plunge my people into a conflict    that'll kill millions of loyal    Romulan citizens, I'll need    something more concrete than the    self-serving arguments of a    Starfleet officer.

39,SISKO,"   Okay you convinced me. They're    going to need evidence...

47,GARAK,"   No one wants to see the Dominion    destroyed more than I do. But asking    me to go to Cardassia Prime,    penetrate one of the most heavily    guarded facilities in the quadrant,    steal top secret war plans and then    return them safely to you is not just    another ""job.""

52,GARAK,"   It would mean calling in all my    favors, captain. To do what    you're asking would use up every    resource I have left on Cardassia.

64,SISKO,"   There's plenty of blame to go    around. The Tenth Fleet was    supposed to be protecting Betazed    and its outlying colonies, but    they were caught out of position    on a training exercise.

265,DAX,   Got a minute?,37   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
266,SISKO,   Sure. What can I do for you?,37   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
267,DAX,"   This may sound... crazy. But,    think about it before you say no.",37   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
268,SISKO,   Just say it.,37   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
269,DAX,   What if we... tricked the Romulans    into believing that the Dominion    was about to attack them?,37   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
270,DAX,"   Hear me out.         We find a way to manufacture    evidence of a planned Dominion    attack. I'm not sure what it    should be, uh... a series of coded    messages from their central    command, a Cardassian defector who    smuggles out secret war plans --    I don't know. Something. Then    we show it to the Romulans and try    to convince them that they're one    step away from disaster.",37   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
271,SISKO,   You want to start a war based on    a lie?,37   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
272,DAX,"   I want to end a war, Benjamin.    And I want the good guys to win.    Besides, let's face it -- the    Dominion will attack the Romulans    eventually, it's just a matter of    time. So, in a way we'd be doing    them a favor by pulling them in    now.",37   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
273,SISKO,        That's an easy way of    rationalizing something you know    is wrong.,37   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
274,DAX,   More wrong than war?,37   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
275,SISKO,   I'll... think about it.,37   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
276,DAX,   That's all I ask.,37   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
277,DAX,   I suppose it's one thing to come    up with an idea like this... and    another to put it into motion.,37   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
278,SISKO,"        That's why they put these on my    collar, old man.",37   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
279,SISKO,"   It was good to know that the old    man was on my side, even if she    didn't know what was really going    on.        In any case, I was way past the    point of no return. There was    nothing to do but wait and see how    masterful Tolar's forgery really    was.",38   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
280,SISKO,"   So I waited. Tried to catch up    on my paperwork, but I couldn't    really focus on criminal activity    reports or cargo manifests... I    went back to pacing and staring    out the window.       I don't think of myself as an   impatient man. I don't agonize   over decisions once they're made.   I got that from my father. He   always said that worry and doubt   were the greatest enemies of a   chef. ""The souffle will rise or   it won't,"" he used to say.   ""There's not a damn thing you can   do about it, so just sit back and   see what happens.""",38   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
281,SISKO ,"        But this time, the cost of failure    was so high, that I found it hard    to follow his advice.",38   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
282,SISKO ,"   If Vreenak discovered the data-rod    was a forgery, if he realized that    we were trying to trick them into    war, it could push the Romulans    even farther into the enemy camp.    They could start to openly help    the Dominion. If worse came to    worst, they could actually join    the war against us. I had the    distinct feeling that victory or    defeat would be decided in the    next few minutes.",39   INT. CORRIDOR,CORRIDOR,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
283,VREENAK,        It's a fake.,40   INT. WARDROOM - CONTINUOUS,WARDROOM,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
284,SISKO,"   So it blew up in my face. The    lies and the compromises, the    inner doubts and the    rationalizations -- all for    nothing. Vreenak was furious.    I can't say I blamed him. I'd    have reacted the same way. After    telling me in no uncertain terms    that he intended to expose this    ""vile deception"" to the entire    Alpha Quadrant, he got back in his    shuttle and headed home.        There didn't seem to be anything    more to do... so I went back to    work.        Two days later we got the news.",41   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
285,BASHIR,       No one for me today.,42   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
286,DAX,   I had one -- Maria Tatalia --    wounded in action.,42   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
287,BASHIR,   Friend?,42   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
288,DAX,"   Friend of a friend. I met her    once, but I doubt she'd remember    me.",42   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
289,BASHIR,"   Only one friend of a friend    between the two of us -- as    strange as it sounds, I'd say    today's off to a good start.",42   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
290,WORF,"   Captain, we just received word from    Starfleet Intelligence that a    Romulan shuttle carrying a high-   ranking senator has been destroyed.",42   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
291,SISKO,   Which Senator?,42   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
292,WORF,"   Senator Vreenak. He was returning    to Romulus from a diplomatic    mission to Soukara when his    shuttle exploded.         The Tal Shiar is investigating,    but their preliminary report    points to sabotage...        ... they believe the Dominion is    responsible.",42   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
293,DAX,   The Dominion assassinated a    Romulan Senator...,42   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
294,BASHIR,   On a diplomatic mission...,42   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
295,WORF,   This changes everything. It could    even bring the Romulans into the    war.,42   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
296,SISKO,        Excuse me.,42   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
297,SISKO,   Get up.,45   INT. GARAK'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS,GARAK'S SHOP,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
298,SISKO,   You killed him.,45   INT. GARAK'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS,GARAK'S SHOP,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
299,GARAK,   That's right.,45   INT. GARAK'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS,GARAK'S SHOP,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
300,SISKO,"   That's what you planned to do all    along. You knew the data-rod    wouldn't hold up to scrutiny, you    just wanted to get him on the    station so you could plant a bomb    on his shuttle.",45   INT. GARAK'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS,GARAK'S SHOP,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
301,GARAK,   It wasn't quite that simple. I    did have hopes that the rod would    somehow pass inspection. But I    suspected that Tolar may not have    been up to the task.,45   INT. GARAK'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS,GARAK'S SHOP,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
302,SISKO,   What about Tolar? Did you kill    him too?,45   INT. GARAK'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS,GARAK'S SHOP,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
303,GARAK,   Think of them both as tragic    victims of war.,45   INT. GARAK'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS,GARAK'S SHOP,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
304,GARAK,"   If you can allow your anger to    subside for a moment, you'll see    that they did not die in vain --    the Romulans will enter the war.",45   INT. GARAK'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS,GARAK'S SHOP,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
305,SISKO,   There's no guarantee of that.,45   INT. GARAK'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS,GARAK'S SHOP,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
306,GARAK,"   Oh, but I think there is. You    see, when the Tal Shiar finishes    examining the wreckage of    Vreenak's shuttle, they'll find    the burnt remnants of a Cardassian    optolythic data-rod which    miraculously survived the    explosion. After painstaking    forensic examination, they'll    discover that the rod contains a    recording of a high-level Dominion    meeting at which the invasion of    Romulus was being planned.",45   INT. GARAK'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS,GARAK'S SHOP,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
307,SISKO,   And then they'll discover it's a    fraud.,45   INT. GARAK'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS,GARAK'S SHOP,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
308,GARAK,"   I don't think so. Any    imperfections in the forgery will    appear to be a result of the    explosion.        So, with a seemingly legitimate    data-rod in one hand and a dead    senator in the other, I ask you    captain, what conclusion would you    draw?",45   INT. GARAK'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS,GARAK'S SHOP,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
309,SISKO,   That Vreenak obtained the rod on    Soukara and that the Dominion    killed him to prevent him from    returning to Romulus with it.,45   INT. GARAK'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS,GARAK'S SHOP,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
310,GARAK,"   Precisely. And the more the    Dominion protests their innocence,    the more the Romulans will believe    they're guilty... because it's    exactly what the Romulans would've    done in their place!",45   INT. GARAK'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS,GARAK'S SHOP,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
311,GARAK,"        That is why you came to me, isn't    it, captain? Because you knew I    could do the things you weren't    capable of doing yourself? Well,    it worked. And you'll get what    you wanted -- a war between the    Romulans and the Dominion. If    your conscience is bothering you,    you should soothe it with the    knowledge that you may have just    saved the entire Alpha Quadrant.    And all it cost was the life of    one Romulan senator, one criminal,    and the self-respect of one    Starfleet Officer. I don't know    about you, but I'd call that a    bargain.",45   INT. GARAK'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS,GARAK'S SHOP,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
312,SISKO,"   This morning, at oh-eight-hundred    hours, station time... the Romulan    Empire formally declared war    against the Dominion. They've    already struck fifteen bases along    the Cardassian border.        So it's a huge victory for the    good guys... perhaps the turning    point of the entire war. There's    even a ""Welcome to the Fight""    party in the wardroom tonight.        I lied. I cheated. I bribed men    to cover up the crimes of other    men. I was an accessory to    murder. But most damning of    all... I think I can live with it. ",46   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
313,SISKO ,   And if I had to do it all over    again... I would. Garak was right    about one thing -- a guilty    conscience is a small price to pay    for the safety of the Alpha    Quadrant. So I'll learn to live    with it.,46   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
314,SISKO,   Because I can live with it.,46   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
315,SISKO,   I can live with it.,46   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
316,SISKO,   Computer -- erase that entire    personal log.,46   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,In the Pale Moonlight,1998-01-26,Deep Space Nine,543.txt
