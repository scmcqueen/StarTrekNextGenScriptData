182,ROSS,   This is unbelievable.       Let's put aside -- for the moment   -- that he's contemplating the   murder of a high-ranking   official.

186,ROSS,"   If you saw the reports from   Starfleet Intelligence that I   see, you wouldn't ask that   question.

196,BASHIR,"   Two things. First, Sloan has too   much information on the inner   workings of their government, too   many insights into their   political process.       Second, Sloan's plan is to kill   Koval while making it appear to   be an accelerated case of Tuvan   Syndrome. To do that, he'd have   to expose Koval to a short burst   of nadion radiation. The   simplest plan would be to   maneuver Koval near a phaser   relay and surreptitiously   irradiate him.       Since I doubt very much that   Sloan will have a chance to do   that, it stands to reason that   someone else will have to do it   for him.",25   INT.

276,BASHIR,   Well... for reasons that are   extremely complicated... I came to   believe that there's a traitor in   your government working for   Section Thirty-one.

282,KOVAL,"   Praetor, this is the man known   as Sloan. Unlike the Doctor, his   mind is quite susceptible to our   data retrieval methods. Under   questioning, he has confirmed   much of what the doctor and the   senator have told you. With one   important exception.       There is no Section Thirty-one.",44   INT. ROMULAN FORUM,ROMULAN FORUM,INT.,Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges,1998-12-01,Deep Space Nine,565.txt
283,KOVAL,"   Sloan, in fact, works for   Starfleet Intelligence. Far from   being the master of a rogue   agency, he is simply one of many   operatives in the employ of the   Federation. He's had a long   career, most of which is still   unknown to us. However, there is   one interesting element that we   do know -- he was the protege of   The late Vice Admiral Fujisaki.",44   INT. ROMULAN FORUM,ROMULAN FORUM,INT.,Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges,1998-12-01,Deep Space Nine,565.txt
284,KOVAL,"   Sloan did not take the death of   his mentor well. He came to   believe that he was murdered --   by the Tal'Shiar. In his eyes,   the assassination of a Starfleet   admiral was... ""stepping over the   line.""       Isn't that the phrase?",44   INT. ROMULAN FORUM,ROMULAN FORUM,INT.,Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges,1998-12-01,Deep Space Nine,565.txt
285,KOVAL,"   After Fujisaki's death, he was   confronted with a dilemma: how   could he seek vengeance without   violating Federation law? His   answer was to invent Section   Thirty-one -- a ""rogue""   organization that answered to no   one.",44   INT.

286,KOVAL ,"   If they killed the head of the   Tal'Shiar, Starfleet Intelligence   would be held blameless       As the Committee knows, I have   been diagnosed with Tuvan   Syndrome. Sloan became aware of   my condition and hoped to make my   death look like a sudden   acceleration of the disease. To   do that, he needed a doctor. So   ten days after Fujisaki's death,   Sloan arranged to ""recruit""   Doctor Bashir into Section Thirty-   one.       After that, Sloan bided his time,   and waited for an opportunity to   present itself. He found one   when he learned of this   conference. He then arranged for   Bashir to be invited. Everything   was going perfectly. But then he   made a fatal mistake -- he   decided to come to Romulus   himself. He was unaware that his   identity had become known to us.   Once we recognized him in the   delegation, we knew immediately   that an intelligence operation   was underway.",44   INT.

291,KOVAL,"   Most definitely. As to the   involvement of the doctor and the   senator...       Doctor Bashir may have intended   to kill me, or he may have   intended to save me. There's no   way to know for certain.       As for Senator Cretak... we all   know she's an ambitious woman.   It is entirely possible that she   would welcome my death...   especially if it meant her being   elevated to the Continuing   Committee in my place.",44   INT.

304,BASHIR,   The man Koval described wasn't   the same man who recruited me   into Section Thirty-one. Anyone   clever enough to pull the wool   over my eyes so completely   wouldn't get caught by the   Romulans that easily. There had   to be another explanation.

317,ROSS,"   No. She wasn't. I told you   before, Julian, she's a patriot.   Which means that if it served the   interests of the Romulans to   negotiate a separate peace with   the Dominion...
