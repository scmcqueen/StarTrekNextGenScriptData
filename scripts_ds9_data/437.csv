Let me tell you about her.  Jadzia    was the quietest, shyest, most    withdrawn young woman you've ever    known.  Brilliant, top grades... and    not a clue to what life was about.     She hadn't lived outside the program.     And it didn't matter because she was    sailing through... until she met    Curzon Dax.  Curzon sized her up in    twenty seconds... and made the next    two weeks the most miserable of her    life.  She cried herself to sleep    every night.  She hated him for it.     But after the field training was    over and she learned about his    recommendation to terminate her from    the program... she went back a    different woman.  She found her voice    and reapplied.  She tore through the    program with a passion, a vengeance.     And in the end, the administrators    chose her for Joining.",40   INT.

389,DAX,   Jadzia Dax is not Curzon Dax... but    I am Dax... and I'm slowly coming to    terms with what that means.  Sometimes    it means gambling or wrestling.     Sometimes it means waking up an    initiate before he slides into the    middle of the pack and gets    overlooked.,40   INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1993-12-17,Deep Space Nine
