453,LI,"   During the occupation I was a member    of a minor resistance cell, the name's    unimportant.  One day, this was in    the mountains surrounding the Sahving    valley, we were ambushed by Cardassian    troops.  Only three of us managed to    escape.  We hid in the hills for two    days, but finally the lack of food    and water forced us down into the    valley.  We made our way to a ridge    above a small lake.  As I was the    only one still carrying a phaser, I    went ahead to scout for the enemy.     Halfway down the embankment I slipped    and went sprawling on my back down    to the edge of the lake just as a    huge Cardassian emerged from the    water.  He must have just finished    bathing.  He stood there frozen in    surprise, dressed only in his    underwear, shivering from the cold.     I lay there looking up at him too    stunned to move.  It was only when    he reached over for a phaser rifle    lying across his clothes on a nearby    rock that I realized I was still    holding my own phaser.  I shot him,    his body collapsed on top of me,    which is how my companions found us    a moment later.",68   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1993-07-02,Deep Space Nine

I    tried to tell them what happened,    but they had already convinced    themselves that I killed Zarale during    some kind of savage struggle.       Which is what they insisted on telling    every Bajoran we met.  And no matter    how hard I denied it, the story    continued to spread until it seemed    all of Bajor had heard it.  Soon    every victory won by the resistance    was attributed to my leadership.     Stories of my courage, my brilliance,    my daring grew more and more    unbelievable... yet people insisted    on believing them.  My reputation    even followed me into the labor    camp... my presence alone seemed to    inspire my fellow prisoners... and    all I had done was shot an unarmed    Cardassian in his underwear.  I'll    never forget that look on his face    as he died.  He was so... embarrassed.       Commander, I did what Bajor needed    me to do.
