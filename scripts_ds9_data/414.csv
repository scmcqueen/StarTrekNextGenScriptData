406,O'BRIEN,   Why do they need a storyteller?,75   INT. SIRAH'S CHAMBER,SIRAH'S CHAMBER,INT.,,1993-02-02,Deep Space Nine

421,VARIS,   I'm afraid he and Nog were just trying    to impress me.,77   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1993-02-02,Deep Space Nine
422,SISKO,   That's not much of an excuse.,77   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1993-02-02,Deep Space Nine
