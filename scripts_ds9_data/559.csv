80,DUKAT,"   Oh, I admit, when I allowed   myself to become a vessel for the   Pah-wraith, I did it for self-   serving reasons.

317,KIRA,   I keep going over what he said   when he died. I don't know if he   was trying to tell me that he   never lost his faith... or that   he felt betrayed by it.,88   INT. DEFIANT - MESS HALL,DEFIANT,INT.,Covenant,1998-09-28,Deep Space Nine,559.txt
318,ODO,"   I suppose you'll never know...       One thing's for certain, these   people were betrayed. And now   they have to find a way to pick   up the pieces and move on.",88   INT. DEFIANT - MESS HALL,DEFIANT,INT.,Covenant,1998-09-28,Deep Space Nine,559.txt
319,KIRA,   I thought Dukat was just claiming   to share their faith because he   wanted them to love him.       But it was more than that. He's   changed.,88   INT. DEFIANT - MESS HALL,DEFIANT,INT.,Covenant,1998-09-28,Deep Space Nine,559.txt
320,ODO,"   Has he? If you hadn't stopped   him, he would've killed them all,   and no one would've known that   his body wasn't among the   remains. That sounds like the   same old Dukat to me.",88   INT. DEFIANT - MESS HALL,DEFIANT,INT.,Covenant,1998-09-28,Deep Space Nine,559.txt
321,KIRA,   I know this is going to sound   crazy... but I think he convinced   himself that he was doing what   the Pah-wraiths wanted.,88   INT. DEFIANT - MESS HALL,DEFIANT,INT.,Covenant,1998-09-28,Deep Space Nine,559.txt
