Almost a century ago, a Terran    starship Captain named James Kirk    accidentally exchanged places with    his counterpart from your side due    to a transporter accident.  Our    Terrans were barbarians then, but    their Empire was strong.  While your    Kirk was on this side, he met a Vulcan    named Spock and somehow had a profound    influence on him.  Afterwards, Spock    rose to commander in chief of the    Empire by preaching reforms,    disarmament, peace.  It was a    remarkable turnabout for his people.     Unfortunately for them, when Spock    had completed all these reforms, his    empire was no longer in any position    to defend itself against us.",14   INT.
