335,O'BRIEN,"   I keep telling myself it doesn't   matter. That it wasn't real. But   that's a lie. If it'd been   real... If it'd been you instead   of Ee'char... it wouldn't have   made any difference. He was my   best friend. And I murdered him.

337,BASHIR,"   No. An animal would've killed   Ee'char and never had a second   thought, never shed a tear. But   not you. You hate yourself for   it. Hate yourself so much you   think you deserve to die. And   that's what makes you human.       The Argrathi did everything they   could to strip away your humanity.   And in the end, for one brief   moment, they succeeded. But you   shouldn't let that one moment   define your entire life. Because   if you do, if you pull that   trigger, the Argrathi will have   won. They'll have destroyed a   good man. And you can't let that   happen.",93   INT.
