136,ARANDIS,   He was a very sweet old man.,14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
137,WORF,   I'll take your word for it.,14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
138,ARANDIS,"       It's good to see you again, Dax.   Your new host is very attractive.",14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
139,DAX,   I like to think so. You haven't   aged a day.,14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
140,ARANDIS,   Risa's been kind to me.,14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
141,ARANDIS,   Come on. Let me show you around   the lagoon.,14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
142,WORF,   Maybe later.,14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
143,ARANDIS,   Of course.       All that is ours is yours.,14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
144,WORF,   Thank you. But we have everything    we need.,14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
145,DAX,   That wasn't very nice.,14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
146,WORF,   Why? Is there something of hers    you want?,14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
147,DAX,"   Arandis was Curzon's lover, not    mine.",14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
148,WORF,   I hope you remember that.,14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
149,DAX,   You're still angry about Captain    Boday.,14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
150,WORF,"   If I am angry, it's because you do    not take our relationship    seriously.",14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
151,DAX,"   Worf, we just got here. Do we    have to start arguing again?",14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
152,WORF,"   If you were a Klingon woman, we    would already be married.",14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
153,DAX,"   In case you haven't noticed, I'm    not a Klingon woman.",14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
154,WORF,   That's no excuse. I have been    loyal to you. And I expect you to be    loyal to me in return.,14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
155,DAX,   I have been loyal to you. But I'm    not going to let you run my life.,14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
156,WORF,   I'm not trying to run your life.,14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
157,DAX,   Good. Then I'm going to go have    a nice big glass of icoberry juice.,14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
158,WORF,   That would be a mistake. You are    allergic to icoberry juice. It    makes your spots itch.,14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
159,DAX,   But I like the taste.,14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
160,WORF,   Fine. Have as much icoberry juice    as you like.       But it is a mistake.,14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
161,DAX,"   But it's my mistake to make.       Now what do you say you go up to    our room, put on a bathing suit,    and we'll go for a swim in the lagoon.",14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
162,WORF,   As you wish.,14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
163,DAX,   Hurry back.,14   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
164,WORF,   Come in.,19   INT. DAX AND WORF'S GUEST CHAMBER - DAY,DAX AND WORF'S GUEST CHAMBER,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
165,FULLERTON,   I hope I'm not disturbing you...        ... lieutenant commander. My name    is Pascal Fullerton. I'm the    Chairman of the New Essentialists    Movement.,19   INT. DAX AND WORF'S GUEST CHAMBER - DAY,DAX AND WORF'S GUEST CHAMBER,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
166,WORF,   I'm not familiar with that    organization.,19   INT. DAX AND WORF'S GUEST CHAMBER - DAY,DAX AND WORF'S GUEST CHAMBER,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
167,FULLERTON,   We're dedicated to restoring the    moral and cultural traditions of   the Federation.,19   INT. DAX AND WORF'S GUEST CHAMBER - DAY,DAX AND WORF'S GUEST CHAMBER,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
168,FULLERTON,"   This is our statement of    principles. And if you want to    hear more, we're holding a rally    later this afternoon.",19   INT. DAX AND WORF'S GUEST CHAMBER - DAY,DAX AND WORF'S GUEST CHAMBER,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
169,WORF,   On Risa?,19   INT. DAX AND WORF'S GUEST CHAMBER - DAY,DAX AND WORF'S GUEST CHAMBER,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
170,FULLERTON,   What better place? This world    revels in the kind of self-   indulgence that's eroding the    foundations of Federation society.   And we intend to shut it down.,19   INT. DAX AND WORF'S GUEST CHAMBER - DAY,DAX AND WORF'S GUEST CHAMBER,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
171,DAX,   I really wish you'd stop reading    that.,20   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - DAY,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
172,WORF,   I would not dismiss Fullerton so    quickly. His analysis of recent    Federation history is insightful.    And very disturbing.,20   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - DAY,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
173,DAX,   What's disturbing is that you're    still wearing that uniform.,20   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - DAY,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
174,WORF,   It would not hurt you to read    this.,20   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - DAY,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
175,LEETA,   Mmm.,20   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - DAY,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
176,LEETA,"   The truth is, not everyone can be    a dabo girl. First of all, you    have to be able to wear the    clothes, and believe me, that's    not easy. You have to be able to    calculate odds in your head very    quickly, and most importantly, you    need a very supple wrist.",20   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - DAY,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
177,LEETA,   Like this. Dabo.,20   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - DAY,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
178,DAX,"   Worf, people have been predicting    the end of the Federation since    the day it was founded. Trust me,   I know...",20   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - DAY,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
179,LEETA,"       Oh, hi.",20   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - DAY,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
180,DAX,   Leeta... what a surprise.,20   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - DAY,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
181,LEETA,   Care to join us? We were just    about to take a reyamilk soak.,20   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - DAY,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
182,DAX,   Maybe later.,20   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - DAY,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
183,WORF,   That was not Doctor Bashir.,20   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - DAY,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
184,DAX,"   Worf, it's none of our business.",20   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - DAY,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
185,WORF,   Are you defending her actions?,20   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - DAY,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
186,DAX,   I'm not defending anything. It's    not my business... or yours.       Now what do you say we sign out a    couple of floaters and take in the    sights.,20   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - DAY,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
187,WORF,   I cannot. The Essentialists are    having a rally and I'm going to    attend.,20   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - DAY,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
188,DAX,   You're kidding.       You're not kidding.,20   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - DAY,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
189,DAX,       Don't these people have anything    better to do?,24   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
190,WORF,   Perhaps you underestimate the    power of Fullerton's message.,24   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
191,DAX,   The plot thickens.,24   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
192,DAX,   And you were worried about Julian.,24   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
193,WORF,   Why are he and Leeta not together?,24   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
194,DAX,   I don't know. But don't jump to    conclusions. I'm sure there's a    reasonable explanation.,24   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
195,WORF,   This place is a bad influence on    people.,24   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
196,ARANDIS,   Here for the show?,24   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
197,WORF,   I would not call it a show.,24   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
198,ARANDIS,   Really? I find Mister Fullerton    very entertaining.,24   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
199,DAX,   He seems pretty determined to    discourage people from coming here.,24   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
200,ARANDIS,"   Risa receives millions of visitors    every year. And all of them leave    happier than when they arrived.    I don't see how one man, no matter    how determined, could change that.",24   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
201,WORF,   Kahless fought off an entire army    at Three Turn Bridge. And he was    only one man.,24   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
202,ARANDIS,"   Fullerton and his Essentialists    have been here for almost a month.   And no matter how many speeches he    gives, the water is still warm,   and the wind still smells sweet.        But if he's enjoying himself, who    are we to discourage him?",24   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
203,FULLERTON,"   That's right. Take a good look.    I can only imagine what you must    think of me. A middle-aged,    ponderous academic, sweating under    the hot Risian suns, wasting his    time telling you things you don't   want to hear.       But you know what I see when I    look at you? Children. Pampered    spoiled children.",24   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
204,BASHIR,"   Am I wrong, or have we just been   insulted?",24   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
205,FULLERTON,"   Somehow the citizens of the    Federation have come to believe    that they're entitled to lives of    ease and privilege. If you want    something to eat, you get it from    a replicator. If you want    amusement, you go to a holosuite.   And if you need protection, you    call for Starfleet. But someday,    someday soon, you're going to have    to learn to take care of yourselves.",24   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
206,FULLERTON,"   Because if I see you as helpless    children, then how do you think    the Borg see you? Or the    Romulans? Or the Klingons or the   Dominion? These empires look at    the Federation and they see a   prize, a prize we've forgotten how    to protect. And if we don't    change our ways, they're going to    take it from us.",24   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
207,ARANDIS,   Mister Fullerton certainly has a    flair for the dramatic.,24   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
208,BASHIR,       Does he really believe that?,24   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
209,DAX,   I think he does.,24   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
210,FULLERTON,"   The way I see it, we've got two    options. We can either turn our    backs on childish things and re-   embrace the hard work that built    the Federation in the first    place...",24   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
211,FULLERTON ,"   ... or we can lie here, napping in    the sun, until we wake up with    Jem'Hadar guns to our heads. The    choice is ours. Heaven help us if    we make the wrong one.",24   EXT. RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY,RISA,EXT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
212,BASHIR,"   Worf, you can't be serious.",26   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - NIGHT,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
213,WORF,"   I am merely observing that the    Klingons never would have attacked    if they hadn't believed the    Federation was vulnerable. Even   now, after the changeling on the    Klingon High Council was exposed,    some of my people continue to call    for war. Because they think they    can win.",26   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - NIGHT,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
214,BASHIR,   None of which has anything to do    with Risa.,26   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - NIGHT,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
215,WORF,   You cannot be certain of that.,26   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - NIGHT,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine

221,BASHIR,   Something wrong?,26   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - NIGHT,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
222,DAX,       It's nothing.,26   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - NIGHT,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
223,WORF,   The two of you dishonor each other    with your actions.,26   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - NIGHT,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
224,LEETA,       Do you know what he's talking about?,26   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - NIGHT,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
225,BASHIR,"       You mean, we never told you why we    came here?",26   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - NIGHT,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
226,BASHIR,   We're conducting the Rite of    Separation.,26   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - NIGHT,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
227,LEETA,"   It's an old Bajoran custom. When    a couple separates, they spend    several days celebrating their    parting. It's a way to remember    all the good times, and to seek    out new... opportunities.",26   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - NIGHT,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
228,BASHIR,       It's a wise and ancient culture.,26   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - NIGHT,RISIAN SOLARIUM,INT.,,1996-09-05,Deep Space Nine
