14,ODO,   You should be going soon.,2    INT. SURGERY,SURGERY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
15,KIRA,   I'm not going anywhere. Garak   and Damar can lead the rebellion   without me.,2    INT. SURGERY,SURGERY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine

43,O'BRIEN,   We should tell you that research   isn't the only avenue we're   pursuing.,3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
44,BASHIR,   Miles...,3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
45,O'BRIEN,   He needs to know.,3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
46,SISKO,"   Let me settle that. Whatever's   going on, I want to know right   now.",3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
47,BASHIR,   We're... trying to lure someone   from Section Thirty-one to the   station.,3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
48,SISKO,   Section Thirty-one? What do they   have to do with this?,3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
49,O'BRIEN,   We believe they're responsible   for infecting Odo in the first   place.,3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
50,SISKO,   What!,3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
51,BASHIR,   We think Odo was infected three   years ago when he was supposedly   undergoing tests at Starfleet   Headquarters.,3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
52,O'BRIEN,"   Evidently, Section Thirty-one   hoped that Odo would transmit the   disease to the others when he   linked with them.",3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
53,SISKO,   Genocide.       Committed by people who call   themselves Federation citizens...       Why didn't you tell me about this   earlier?,3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
54,O'BRIEN,   We felt that if we did --,3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
55,BASHIR,"   The chief wanted to tell you, but   as senior officer, I ordered him   not to. It's my fault.",3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
56,SISKO,   I'm still waiting for an answer   to my question.,3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
57,BASHIR,"   We have no proof. Besides... I   knew that if we told you what we   suspected, you'd feel an   obligation to report it to   Starfleet Command. And once you   did, Section Thirty-one would   most likely find out that we were   onto them and go even deeper into   hiding.",3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
58,SISKO,   What difference does that make?,3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
59,BASHIR,"   There came a point where I had to   admit that my research was going   nowhere. I wasn't going to find   a cure in the lab. So, the chief   and I decided to look for it in   Section Thirty-one itself. A   few days ago, I sent a false   message to Starfleet Medical   announcing that I had found a   cure.",3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
60,O'BRIEN,"   The idea is that when Thirty-one   hears about it, they'll want to   destroy Julian's research to   prevent it from falling into the   Dominion's hands.",3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
61,SISKO,"   So you're trying to lure one of   their operatives to the station.   Okay, let's say it works. What   then?",3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
62,BASHIR,"   We capture him, or her, and then   try to find out what they know   about the disease, who's   involved, and maybe even where to   find the cure.",3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
63,SISKO,   And how do you propose to do   that? I doubt they'll be very   cooperative.,3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
64,BASHIR,   I've... managed to get my hands   on a Romulan memory scanner.,3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
65,SISKO,"   Since they're illegal in the   Federation, I'll assume that's   another reason why you didn't   come to me.",3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
66,BASHIR,"   Yes, sir.",3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
67,SISKO,   Setting aside the legal and   ethical issues involved... this   still seems like a long shot.,3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
68,BASHIR,   It is. But I'm afraid it may be   the only shot Odo has.,3    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
69,QUARK,   I just wanted to... come by to   see how you're doing...,6    INT. SURGERY,SURGERY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
70,QUARK,   I hear the prognosis is... well...,6    INT. SURGERY,SURGERY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
71,QUARK,"   There's something you might like   to know, before...       Something we've never talked   about... even though I'm sure   it's always been... in the back   of our minds...       It has to do with the... Tilavan   art theft. I think I know who   stole the holo-sculptures.",6    INT. SURGERY,SURGERY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
72,ODO,       Tell me.,6    INT. SURGERY,SURGERY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
73,QUARK,   On second thought... why bother?,6    INT. SURGERY,SURGERY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
74,ODO,   What?,6    INT. SURGERY,SURGERY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
75,QUARK,   It's not like you're in any shape   to do something about it. Forget   I brought it up.,6    INT. SURGERY,SURGERY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
76,ODO,   I've spent nine years working on   that case ,6    INT. SURGERY,SURGERY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
77,QUARK,   I know. That's why it's such a   shame that you won't have time to   close it before you...,6    INT. SURGERY,SURGERY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
78,ODO,   You're going to tell me exactly   what you know and you're going to   do it right now.,6    INT. SURGERY,SURGERY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
79,QUARK,"   Oh. Suddenly you're not so sick   after all. You want to crack the   case? Then stop malingering and   get back to work. When you do,   you know where to find me.",6    INT. SURGERY,SURGERY,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine

91,BASHIR,   Section Thirty-one... I kept   thinking about how many people   had to be involved in the   conspiracy to infect Odo with the   disease. Doctors... security   officers... admirals... computer   experts... clerks...       I came up with at least seventy-   three people.,9    INT.

130,BASHIR,   You came here because you thought   I'd discovered the cure and you   wanted to destroy it. But first   you'd have to find it in my lab.   And how would you do that unless   you knew exactly what you were   looking for?,11   INT. SCIENCE LAB (OPTICAL),SCIENCE LAB,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
131,BASHIR,"   You'd never do anything so...   sloppy. You prefer surgical   precision. You came here to   destroy the cure, which means   somewhere in that brain of yours   is the information I want.",11   INT. SCIENCE LAB (OPTICAL),SCIENCE LAB,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine

144,SLOAN,   I misread you. I thought you   were just a misguided idealist.   But you're a dangerous man.

170,BASHIR,"   The entire experience will be   processed into images and sounds   that my conscious mind can   understand.

172,BASHIR,"   As strange as it sounds, it might   be just that simple. On the   other hand, the experience could   be much more surrealistic... I   could find myself caught up in   memories of Sloan's childhood.",16   INT. SCIENCE LAB,SCIENCE LAB,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
173,O'BRIEN,   Will he be... aware of what   you're doing?,16   INT. SCIENCE LAB,SCIENCE LAB,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
174,BASHIR,   I won't know that until I'm   there. We don't know what the   conscious mind can perceive when   it's this close to brain death.,16   INT. SCIENCE LAB,SCIENCE LAB,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
175,O'BRIEN,   How will you get out?,17   INT. SCIENCE LAB,SCIENCE LAB,INT.,,1999-03-05,Deep Space Nine
176,BASHIR,"   One of the advantages to being   genetically enhanced is the   ability to control your own vital   signs.
