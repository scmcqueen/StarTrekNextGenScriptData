22,NOG,"   They're loud, obnoxious, and if I    may say so sir, generally    intoxicated. They walk around the    station like they own the place.

26,JAKE,   Not as annoying as listening to    him complain about it all the    time.,1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,Blaze of Glory,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine,521.txt
27,SISKO,"   Here's what I suggest, cadet.    Next time the Klingons refuse to    acknowledge your presence... do    what a Klingon would do. Confront    them about it.

37,SISKO,        This is a Maquis code.,1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,Blaze of Glory,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine,521.txt
38,MARTOK,   I was as surprised as you. I    thought the Maquis had been wiped    out by Cardassia and their    Dominion allies. But it would    appear I was mistaken.,1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,Blaze of Glory,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine,521.txt
39,SISKO,   Were you able to decode it?,1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,Blaze of Glory,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine,521.txt
40,REBECCA,"   Michael. I hope you get this    message. We've launched the    missiles. They should reach    Cardassia in thirteen days.

42,MARTOK,"   No. But that proves nothing.         A few months ago, the Klingon high    council decided to aid the Maquis    in their fight against Cardassia.    We provided them with thirty Class-   Four cloaking devices. It was our    understanding that they would use    them on their ships.",1    INT.
