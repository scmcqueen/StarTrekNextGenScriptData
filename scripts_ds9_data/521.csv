3,SISKO,   I'm glad you like it.,1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
4,NOG,   Sir... if I may say so... this    sauce tastes very familiar.,1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
5,SISKO,   It should. It's puree of tube    grubs.,1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
6,JAKE,   Tube grubs?,1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
7,SISKO,"   I figured if Nog is willing to eat    squid, it's only fair that we try    tube grubs. Besides, you said it    was terrific.",1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
8,JAKE,   That was before I knew what it    was.,1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine

15,NOG,"   No, sir. Everything's quite    satisfactory. Thank you, sir.",1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine

19,SISKO,   What about them?,1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
20,NOG,"   It's their... attitude, sir. It's    bad.",1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
21,SISKO,   Bad?,1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
22,NOG,"   They're loud, obnoxious, and if I    may say so sir, generally    intoxicated. They walk around the    station like they own the place.    And whenever a station security    officer tries to talk to them, say    to ask them to keep the noise    level down on the Promenade...    they ignore him.",1    INT.

23,JAKE,   You mean they ignore you.,1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
24,NOG,"   They never look me in the eye when    I talk to them, sir. They just    stare over my head and pretend I'm    not even there.        I hate it when they do that.",1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
25,SISKO,   I can see how that might be    annoying.,1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
26,JAKE,   Not as annoying as listening to    him complain about it all the    time.,1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
27,SISKO,"   Here's what I suggest, cadet.    Next time the Klingons refuse to    acknowledge your presence... do    what a Klingon would do. Confront    them about it. If you stand up to    them, you'll earn their respect.",1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine

34,NOG,   But sir...,1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
35,JAKE,   Let's go.,1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
36,MARTOK,"   Captain, my crew and I were    patrolling the Cardassian border,    and we intercepted a very    disturbing message.",1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
37,SISKO,        This is a Maquis code.,1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
38,MARTOK,   I was as surprised as you. I    thought the Maquis had been wiped    out by Cardassia and their    Dominion allies. But it would    appear I was mistaken.,1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
39,SISKO,   Were you able to decode it?,1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
40,REBECCA,"   Michael. I hope you get this    message. We've launched the    missiles. They should reach    Cardassia in thirteen days. It    may not bring back our dead, but    at least they're going to have a    lot of company.",1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
41,SISKO,   Did you detect any missiles?,1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
42,MARTOK,"   No. But that proves nothing.         A few months ago, the Klingon high    council decided to aid the Maquis    in their fight against Cardassia.    We provided them with thirty Class-   Four cloaking devices. It was our    understanding that they would use    them on their ships.",1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
43,SISKO,   But they could've been mounted on    missiles instead.,1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
44,MARTOK,   You see the problem.,1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
45,SISKO,"   The Maquis had access to tricobalt    explosives, biogenic weapons, anti-   matter warheads...",1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine

47,SISKO,"   I knew the Maquis were desperate,    but I can't believe they'd resort    to something like this.",1    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS,SISKO'S QUARTERS,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine

76,EDDINGTON,   Why should I? It has nothing to    do with me. Michael is a very    common name.,12   INT. STARBASE BRIG,STARBASE BRIG,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine
77,SISKO,   True. But somehow I think you're    the right one.,12   INT. STARBASE BRIG,STARBASE BRIG,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1997-03-06,Deep Space Nine

80,EDDINGTON,"   If you expect me to shed a tear,    you're going to be disappointed.    I used up all my tears when the    Dominion slaughtered the Maquis.
