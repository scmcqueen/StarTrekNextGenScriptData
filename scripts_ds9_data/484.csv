10,SISKO,"   I don't like this. The more I   read Starfleet's reports on the   sabotage of the power relays, the   more unanswered questions I have.       How were the changelings able to   infiltrate the Division of   Planetary operations? Where did   they get the codes for the   Division's computer control   network? And how did they manage   to overload every power relay on   Earth at the same time?",3    INT.

16,SISKO,"   That's strange. During the   blackout, Starfleet mobilized   hundreds of units. Why would they   have demobilized Red Squad?",3    INT. SISKO'S TEMPORARY OFFICE - DAY,SISKO'S TEMPORARY OFFIC,INT.,Paradise Lost,1995-11-02,Deep Space Nine,484.txt
17,ODO,   That's why I brought it up. But   if they're cadets... I suppose   Starfleet wanted to get them out   of harm's way.,3    INT. SISKO'S TEMPORARY OFFICE - DAY,SISKO'S TEMPORARY OFFIC,INT.,Paradise Lost,1995-11-02,Deep Space Nine,484.txt

103,ODO,"   Well then let's say he's telling   the truth... that he was ordered   by his superiors to sabotage the   power relays. That still doesn't   rule out Dominion involvement.   For all we know, his superiors   have been replaced by changelings.",10A  INT. SISKO'S CREOLE KITCHEN - NIGHT ,SISKO'S CREOLE KITCHE,INT.,Paradise Lost,1995-11-02,Deep Space Nine,484.txt

116,JARESH-INYO,"   Captain, I have been in politics   for seventy years. I'm no   stranger to overstatement and   exaggeration. But the idea that   Starfleet would plot to overthrow   the government of the Federation   is the single most astonishing   accusation I've ever heard.",12   INT.

119,ODO,"   Several months ago, I learned from   one of my people that changelings   had infiltrated the Federation.   Not long after I gave this   information to Starfleet, records   indicate that Admiral Leyton led   a contingent of high ranking   officers to meet with you and   recommend the implementation of   sweeping security measures meant   to protect Earth.",12   INT.

121,ODO,   It's no secret that Leyton didn't   agree with you.,12   INT. PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS,PRESIDENT'S OFFIC,INT.,Paradise Lost,1995-11-02,Deep Space Nine,484.txt
122,ODO ,"   And despite your calls for calm,   his concern about the Dominion   threat continued to grow.",12   INT. PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS,PRESIDENT'S OFFIC,INT.,Paradise Lost,1995-11-02,Deep Space Nine,484.txt

124,JARESH-INYO,   And so the Admiral approached me   again. That time with you two at   his side. And I agreed to his   proposals.,12   INT. PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS,PRESIDENT'S OFFIC,INT.,Paradise Lost,1995-11-02,Deep Space Nine,484.txt
125,SISKO,   To some of his proposals.,12   INT. PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS,PRESIDENT'S OFFIC,INT.,Paradise Lost,1995-11-02,Deep Space Nine,484.txt
126,ODO,   We believe that Admiral Leyton and   his supporters weren't satisfied   with the limited security   procedures you authorized. They   were convinced that extraordinary   measures were necessary to counter   the changeling threat.,12   INT. PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS,PRESIDENT'S OFFIC,INT.,Paradise Lost,1995-11-02,Deep Space Nine,484.txt
127,SISKO,"   More than that, they were   determined to prove to you and to   everyone else just how vulnerable   Earth was to a Dominion takeover.

129,SISKO,   I know exactly how you feel. But   it's the truth.,12   INT. PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS,PRESIDENT'S OFFIC,INT.,Paradise Lost,1995-11-02,Deep Space Nine,484.txt
130,JARESH-INYO,"   I find that difficult to believe.   Admiral Leyton may be somewhat   grating and inflexible at times,   but for a man of his   accomplishments, of his   distinguished record... to commit   treason?",12   INT. PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS,PRESIDENT'S OFFIC,INT.,Paradise Lost,1995-11-02,Deep Space Nine,484.txt
131,SISKO,   I'm sure the Admiral doesn't see   it as treason. He would probably   defend it as a desperate act of   patriotism. Leyton and his   supporters think their actions are   both necessary and justified.,12   INT.

132,ODO,"   Not to mention effective.       Think about it.

133,JARESH-INYO,"   Your story has a certain logic to   it, gentlemen. But what it lacks   so far is proof.",12   INT. PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS,PRESIDENT'S OFFIC,INT.,Paradise Lost,1995-11-02,Deep Space Nine,484.txt
134,SISKO,   You want proof... Order Admiral   Leyton to withdraw his troops from   the streets... see what he does.,12   INT. PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS,PRESIDENT'S OFFIC,INT.,Paradise Lost,1995-11-02,Deep Space Nine,484.txt
135,JARESH-INYO,   You think he would refuse a direct   order from his commander-in-chief?,12   INT. PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS,PRESIDENT'S OFFIC,INT.,Paradise Lost,1995-11-02,Deep Space Nine,484.txt
136,SISKO,"   If he orders his troops to stand   down, then I'm wrong and I'll   offer my resignation. But I don't   think that's going to happen.   With those troops in place,   Admiral Leyton controls Earth.   And he's not going to give up that   control until he's convinced he's   ended the Dominion threat.",12   INT.

137,JARESH-INYO,"   And he may not have to give up   anything.       If what you say is true, if the   power outage was all part of   Leyton's plan, then it's worked   perfectly. Right now the public   overwhelmingly supports the   increased security. If I tried to   remove the troops, over Leyton's   objections, I'd have a planetwide   riot on my hands.",12   INT.

150,NOG,   I mean he's gone. And as far as   I can tell so is every other   member of Red Squad. The rumor is   they've all been sent on some kind   of training exercise.,13   INT. SISKO'S CREOLE KITCHEN - NIGHT,SISKO'S CREOLE KITCHE,INT.,Paradise Lost,1995-11-02,Deep Space Nine,484.txt

171,LEYTON,   Do you remember when we were on   the Okinawa fighting the   Tzenkethi? That time when I   wanted to take the ship into an   asteroid belt to chase down those   three raiders.

173,LEYTON,   You spoke your mind. Which is   exactly what a good executive   officer is supposed to do. But I   overruled you.
