41,BASHIR,   Maybe he just wanted to see you in   your dress uniform. It does show   off your figure.,3    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
42,O'BRIEN,"   Why, thank you.",3    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine

44,DAX,   Sorry. There were so many people   on the Promenade it was hard to   get through.,3    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
45,KIRA,   I hope Shakaar's gotten better at   talking in front of groups. He   used to mumble his way through   mission briefings; everyone in our   resistance cell had to learn to   lip read.,3    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine

59,SARISH,   Don't forget to mention the   transit subsidies you just   allocated. Tell them they can   expect the price of transport to   Bajor to start dropping within a   few months.,4    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine

61,KIRA,   Good luck.,4    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
62,SHAKAAR,   Let's go.,4    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
63,ODO,   Odo to Captain Sisko.,4    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
64,SISKO,"   Go ahead, Constable.",4    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,AIRLOCK CORRIDOR,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
65,ODO,   I just received a disturbing   communication. I have reason to   believe that someone is planning   to assassinate First Minister   Shakaar.,5    INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
66,ODO,       As far as I'm concerned we   should've gotten the First   Minister off that podium as soon   as we received the information.,6    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
67,SARISH,"   If Shakaar canceled his public   appearances every time someone   threatened his life, he'd never   leave his office.",6    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
68,ODO,"   We're not talking about some   disgruntled shopkeeper who writes   a letter threatening Shakaar for   raising taxes, we're talking about   a Cardassian extremist group   that's already succeeded in   assassinating two Bajoran   officials.",6    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
69,SARISH,"   I know all about ""The True Way""   and what they're capable of.",6    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
70,ODO,"   My sources in the Cardassian   Civilian Government believe ""The   True Way"" already has an operative   in place aboard the station. I   suggest you cancel the First   Minister's conference and   reschedule it at another location.",6    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
71,SARISH,   Absolutely not. Nothing is going   to keep Shakaar from meeting with   those Delegates tomorrow.,6    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
72,SARISH ,   Bajor's effort to join the   Federation hinges on what happens   over the next few days.,6    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
73,SISKO,   Shouldn't the decision be up to   the First Minister?,6    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
74,SARISH,   It will be. But I already know   what he's going to say.,6    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
75,KIRA,"   So do I. Shakaar knows better   than anyone that you can't   capitulate to terrorists. He used   to be one, and the day the   Cardassians started negotiating   with him was the day he knew   they'd been beaten.       He'll stay.",6    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
76,SISKO,"   I suppose I'd do the same thing if   I were in his position.       Constable, I want station security   stepped up for the duration of   Shakaar's visit.",6    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
77,ODO,       The First Minister will have round-   the-clock protection. I'd like to   deploy Starfleet Security   Personnel in addition to my own   deputies.,6    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
78,SISKO,   Of course.       Commander Eddington is on leave...   I'll ask Mister Worf to head up   Starfleet Security while he's   gone.,6    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
79,ODO,"   I've cleared the rooms above,   below and to both sides of the   First Minister's quarters.",6A   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
80,WORF,   I would recommend clearing that   entire section of the Habitat   Ring.,6A   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
81,ODO,   I'm afraid that isn't feasible;   there are over twelve hundred   people living there.,6A   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
82,WORF,   Providing security was difficult   enough aboard the Enterprise. It   appears to be next to impossible   on this station.,6A   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
83,ODO,   It's not easy.,6A   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
84,WORF,   I prefer a more... orderly   environment.,6A   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
85,ODO,   We have that in common. My people   have an innate need for order.,6A   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
86,WORF,   How do you tolerate living here?,6A   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
87,ODO,"   I make order where I can. For one   thing, I have a daily routine, and   I follow it unwaveringly. The   shopkeepers on the Promenade joke   that they can set their clocks by   me.",6A   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
88,WORF,"   Unfortunately, I have found it   difficult to establish a routine   here.",6A   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
89,ODO,"   There are other ways to create   order in your life. Your   quarters, for example. Everything   in mine has its specific place.   And it's all arranged just so.",6A   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
90,WORF,"   Yes... mine, too. Even with my   eyes closed, I would still know   where everything was.",6A   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
91,ODO,   Exactly.,6A   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
92,WORF,   I couldn't tolerate it any other   way.,6A   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
93,ODO,"   And I'll tell you what else to do.   Make sure everyone knows that they   can't just ""drop by"" your quarters   to say hello.",6A   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
94,ODO,"   If someone does, whatever happens,   don't make them feel welcome.",6A   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
95,WORF,   Of course not. That would    invite subsequent visits.,6A   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
96,ODO,   Precisely.,6A   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
97,WORF,"   So far, the only person who has a   tendency to ""drop by"" is Chief   O'Brien.",6A   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
98,ODO,   That's probably because he knows   you from the Enterprise.,6A   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
99,WORF,"       Perhaps if I am more inhospitable,   he will stop.",6A   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
100,ODO,       Good luck.,6A   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine

107,WORF,   The wardroom will be scanned and   secured well before then.,9    INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine

115,SARISH,   I didn't know myself until a   moment ago.,10   INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR,HABITAT RING CORRIDOR,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
116,SHAKAAR,   Is there a problem?,10   INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR,HABITAT RING CORRIDOR,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
117,ODO,   I would have posted extra security   on the Promenade.,10   INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR,HABITAT RING CORRIDOR,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine

123,SHAKAAR,   They could've given that job to   one of their own people. They   must've thought very highly of   you.,11   INT. PROMENADE ,PROMENADE ,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
124,SHAKAAR,   I know Kira does. She once told   me she trusted you with her life.,11   INT. PROMENADE ,PROMENADE ,INT.,,1995-11-14,Deep Space Nine
