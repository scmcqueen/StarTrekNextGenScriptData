345,TABAN,"   I know it's only been a few weeks    that we've been back home, but you    should see the children. It's    like they've been transformed.    Reon and Pohl are laughing and    playing together -- they've never    been happier. And I swear, little    Nerys must've gained five pounds.        Of course they keep asking for    you... I've told them you're still    at the refugee center. I think    that's best, at least for the time    being.        I can't believe how much I miss    you. I think about you all the    time.

357,KIRA,"        I've always hated collaborators.        After all, what could be worse    than betraying your own people?    During the occupation, if I ever    had doubts about what their fate    should be... all I had to do was    think of my mother and how she    gave her life for Bajor.

361,KIRA,   I did some checking... my mother    died in a Cardassian hospital    seven years after meeting Dukat.         They were together seven years.
