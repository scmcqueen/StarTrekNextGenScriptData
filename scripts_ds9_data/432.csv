379,SISKO,"   Chief, based on your knowledge of    its behavior, if we can lure him    out, is there any way to set up a    forcefield that can hold him...",61   INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1993-10-27,Deep Space Nine
380,O'BRIEN,   We could reverse polarity on the    energy fields and it might work...    but that's only a guess.,61   INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1993-10-27,Deep Space Nine
381,SISKO,"   Set it up on the Promenade... I want    a lot of room to operate... Major,    station security teams along the    perimeter...",61   INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1993-10-27,Deep Space Nine

383,O'BRIEN,   Maybe we can use some R-F energy    bursts to attract him...,61   INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1993-10-27,Deep Space Nine
384,MORA,   I think there's only one thing that's    going to attract that creature into    your trap.  It's me he's after.,61   INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1993-10-27,Deep Space Nine

389,SISKO,"       We can't be sure which vent he'll    come through.  Hopefully, it'll be    the first one available to him...       ... over there... but if not, there    are seventeen others he might choose.     We're not stationing officers near    any of them... we don't want to scare    him away.",65   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1993-10-27,Deep Space Nine
390,MORA,   I understand.,65   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1993-10-27,Deep Space Nine

404,BASHIR,"   I'm not going to try to explain    exactly what happened to you, Odo...    because I haven't the vaguest idea...    I can tell you with Doctor Mora's    help we've managed to eliminate all    traces of the gas from your cellular    structure... I'll prescribe rest    because it's hard for a doctor to go    wrong with that one... but otherwise,    there's not much more I can do for    you.",80   INT.
