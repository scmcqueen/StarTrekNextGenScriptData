176,ODO,   I'm not sure.       But Bek and Kubus did know each other.

306,O'BRIEN,   They were erased all right.,82A  INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,The Collaborator,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine,444.txt
307,KIRA,   Is there anything you can do about    it?,82A  INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,The Collaborator,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine,444.txt
308,O'BRIEN,   I could scan the empty file for traces    of recurring data fragments... There's    always a faint residue of the original    data if you know where to look.  But    to unscramble those fragments so    they form a coherent pattern could    take a while...,82A  INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,The Collaborator,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine,444.txt

311,O'BRIEN,"   Maybe I can't get you the data, but    I might be able to find out who erased    it.  Their retinal scan would've    been noted by the authorization    subroutine when they logged on.",82A  INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,The Collaborator,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine,444.txt
312,KIRA,"   But wouldn't the scan have been    erased, too?",82A  INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,The Collaborator,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine,444.txt
313,O'BRIEN,"   Sure.  But even a fragment of a    retinal scan might be enough to    identify the user.  Here, I'll run a    sweep of the authorization subroutine    and see if we can find anything.",82A  INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,The Collaborator,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine,444.txt
314,O'BRIEN,"   Okay, these are mathematical    representations of fragments of the    retinal scan.  We can use them to    reassemble a portion of the original    image.",82A  INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,The Collaborator,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine,444.txt
315,O'BRIEN,   Not bad.  Now we'll cross-reference    it with the Assembly's main Archive    and try and see who it belongs to.,82A  INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,The Collaborator,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine,444.txt

331,BAREIL,   You already know the answer.,95   INT. TEMPLE SHRINE CHAMBER (OPTICAL),TEMPLE SHRINE CHAMBER,INT.,The Collaborator,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine,444.txt
332,KIRA,   I won't believe it until I hear it    from you.,95   INT. TEMPLE SHRINE CHAMBER (OPTICAL),TEMPLE SHRINE CHAMBER,INT.,The Collaborator,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine,444.txt

334,KIRA,   I don't have any choice.  Winn is    waiting to hear from me.  Do you    really want me to tell her that you    were the one who ordered Bek to give    the Cardassians the location of the    resistance base?  That you were    responsible for the deaths of those    forty-three people?       That you killed Kai Opaka's son?,95   INT.

335,BAREIL,"    (blurting it out,     trying to stop Kira     from talking)   The Cardassians were determined to    eliminate all resistance in the Kendra    Valley.  If someone hadn't told them    the location of the base, they    would've wiped out every village in    the area.  That would've meant the    deaths of twelve hundred innocent    Bajorans.       I couldn't allow that.",95   INT. TEMPLE SHRINE CHAMBER (OPTICAL),TEMPLE SHRINE CHAMBER,INT.,The Collaborator,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine,444.txt
