Your name    was number four on the list.       Personally, I think you all got off    too easy.",42   INT. SECURITY - HOLDING AREA,SECURITY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
117,KUBUS,   I'd like to appeal that ruling.,42   INT. SECURITY - HOLDING AREA,SECURITY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
118,KIRA,   There are no appeals.  You'll be    placed on the next transport headed    out of Bajoran space.,42   INT. SECURITY - HOLDING AREA,SECURITY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine

120,KUBUS,"   Major, I'm an old man.  I don't have    many years left.  What's the harm in    letting me live them out on Bajor?",42   INT. SECURITY - HOLDING AREA,SECURITY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
121,KIRA,"   When the Cardassians needed a new    group of Bajorans to work in the    mines, who approved the work orders?",42   INT. SECURITY - HOLDING AREA,SECURITY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
122,KUBUS,   The Bajoran Government.,42   INT. SECURITY - HOLDING AREA,SECURITY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
123,KIRA,   Whose signature was on the    authorization forms?,42   INT. SECURITY - HOLDING AREA,SECURITY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
124,KUBUS,       Mine.,42   INT. SECURITY - HOLDING AREA,SECURITY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
125,KIRA,   You had to know those authorizations    were death sentences.  Did you ever    once refuse to sign them?,42   INT. SECURITY - HOLDING AREA,SECURITY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
126,KUBUS,       No.,42   INT. SECURITY - HOLDING AREA,SECURITY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
127,KIRA,"       And that's why you can never be    allowed to set foot on Bajor again.     If you did, it would dishonor the    memory of every person you sentenced    to death.",42   INT. SECURITY - HOLDING AREA,SECURITY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine

129,WINN,"   Emissary, it has recently come to my    attention that there are some on    Bajor who believe my relationship    with you is not all it should be.",47   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
130,SISKO,   Really?,47   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
131,WINN,"   Personally, I find such a perception,    however inaccurate, to be most    distressing.",47   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
132,SISKO,       I suppose the question we have to    ask ourselves is whether or not that    perception is inaccurate?,47   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
133,WINN,"   Don't tell me that you, yourself,    Emissary, believe you and I are...    how shall I put this...",47   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
134,SISKO,       Enemies?,47   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
135,WINN,       At odds.,47   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
136,SISKO,"   Well, let's see.  How could I have    come to such a conclusion?       Maybe it has something to do with    the fact that the last time you were    on this station, you claimed I was a    danger to Bajor.  That I was here to    destroy your people.",47   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
137,WINN,"   I'm afraid you, like some others,    may have misinterpreted me.  Though    I agree that, taken out of context,    my words might appear... inflammatory.",47   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
138,SISKO,   Perhaps you should clarify yourself.,47   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
139,WINN,"   What I was really saying... and what    I have always maintained... is that    you, Emissary, were sent here by the    Prophets, to challenge our long-held    beliefs.  To enable Bajorans    everywhere to come to a new, deeper    understanding of our personal    spirituality.",47   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
140,SISKO,       I see.  I have to admit that    interpretation never occurred to me.       Let me make sure there are no further    misunderstandings between us.  Am I    right in assuming that you no longer    consider the Federation to be an    enemy of Bajor?,47   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
141,WINN,"   Emissary, I admit that I had some    concerns about Bajor's application    for Federation membership.  But now    I see that the Federation's presence    here is essential to our long-term    security and growth.",47   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
142,SISKO,   Then you support the idea of Bajor    joining the Federation?,47   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
143,WINN,"   If that is the will of the Prophets,    I would never oppose it.",47   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
144,SISKO,   I'd be grateful if you'd tell that    to the Bajoran people.,47   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
145,WINN,"   Nothing would make me happier than    to please you, Emissary.    (Winn brightens as if     she's just had a     great idea)   Perhaps you and I could address the    Vedek Assembly together.  So that    everyone can celebrate our new    friendship.",47   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
146,SISKO,   An excellent idea.  Maybe some time    next week...,47   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
147,WINN,"   Why wait, Emissary?  I'm sure the    Assembly would grant us an immediate    audience.",47   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
148,SISKO,"   I'm sure they would.  Unfortunately,    if we were to appear in public    together before the choosing, it    might be misconstrued as an    endorsement of your bid to become    Kai.",47   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
149,WINN,"   I doubt that, Emissary.  It's common    knowledge that you support Vedek    Bareil.  Although I've been pleasently    surprised that you haven't made any    public statement to that effect.       As of yet.",47   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine

151,WINN,       What an enlightened philosophy.,47   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
152,SISKO,"    (not letting her off     the hook)   So then, it's agreed.  I'll be seeing    you sometime next week.  I'm sure    our appearing together in front of    the Vedek Assembly will do wonders    for Federation/Bajoran relations.",47   INT.

159,KIRA,       How can that be?,52   INT. KIRA'S QUARTERS,KIRA'S QUARTERS,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
160,ODO,   Vedek Winn has granted him sanctuary.,52   INT. KIRA'S QUARTERS,KIRA'S QUARTERS,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
161,KIRA,   I'll be right there.,52   INT. KIRA'S QUARTERS,KIRA'S QUARTERS,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
162,KIRA,       Kira to Ops.,52   INT. KIRA'S QUARTERS,KIRA'S QUARTERS,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine

164,KIRA,"   Dax, has Winn's ship left the station?",52   INT. KIRA'S QUARTERS,KIRA'S QUARTERS,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
165,DAX,"       Not yet, but I was about to clear    them for departure.",53   INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
166,KIRA,   Keep those docking clamps locked on.     I don't want that ship going anywhere    until I say so.,53   INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
167,DAX,       Understood.,53   INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
168,KIRA,       Tell me what happened.,54   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
169,ODO,    (eyes still on the     computer)   Kubus requested a private meeting    with Vedek Winn.  They talked for    ten minutes.  After which Winn asked    for the use of my computer.  She    accessed some information from the    library system.,54   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
170,KIRA,   And?,54   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
171,ODO,   And then she called the Provisional    Government and informed them she was    granting Kubus sanctuary.,54   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
172,KIRA,   Do you know what she looked up?,54   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
173,ODO,   I'm trying to find out right now.,54   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
174,ODO,       Hmm.,54   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
175,KIRA,   That's Prylar Bek.  Why would Winn    be interested in another Bajoran    collaborator?,54   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
176,ODO,   I'm not sure.       But Bek and Kubus did know each other.     Bek was the liaison between the    Cardassians and the Vedek Assembly    at the same time Kubus was Secretary    to the Occupational Government.     They spent a lot of time together on    the station.,54   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
177,KIRA,       Hold on a minute.  See if Winn    accessed any information on the Kendra    Valley Massacre.,54   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
178,ODO,"   You're right, she did.  Do you think    Kubus told her something new about    the Massacre?",54   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
179,KIRA,   What else is there to know?,54   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
180,KIRA ,   Kai Opaka's son and forty-two other    Bajoran freedom fighters were ambushed    and killed because Bek gave the    Cardassians the location of their    encampment.  He made a full confession    in his suicide note.  You were here    then.  You must've read it yourself.,54   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
181,WINN ,   Major Kira.,54   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
182,WINN,   May I speak to you?,54   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
183,KIRA,   Of course.,54   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
184,WINN,   I was told you were the one who    stopped my ship from leaving.,58A  INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
185,KIRA,"   That's right.  I did.       You're the last person I would expect    to help a collaborator like Kubus.     Unless, of course, he has something    you need.",58A  INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
186,WINN,"   My needs are no concern of yours,    child.       Now I suggest that you allow my ship    to depart immediately.",58A  INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
187,KIRA,"       You're free to leave any time you    want.       Unfortunately, in light of public    feelings about Kubus, I can't allow    any ship with him aboard to leave    the station until it's undergone a    thorough security check to prevent    sabotage.",58A  INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
188,KIRA ,   And that includes a molecular scan    for nanotechnology.,58A  INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
189,WINN,   How long would such a scan take?,58A  INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
190,KIRA,"   I'm no expert, but I'm sure it could    take days... or even weeks.",58A  INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
191,WINN,"   Very well.  It seems the Prophets    have decided you will have a part in    this after all.    (laying her cards on     the table)   In exchange for sanctuary, Kubus has    agreed to provide the name of the    man who was responsible for the    Massacre at Kendra Valley.",58A  INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
192,KIRA,   Prylar Bek was responsible for the    massacre.  Everyone knows that.,58A  INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
193,WINN,   Bek was a pawn... an intermediary.     He killed himself to prevent the    discovery of the real traitor.,58A  INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
194,KIRA,   The real traitor?,58A  INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
195,WINN,   Bek's superior... the person who    ordered him to reveal the location    of the rebel base to the    Cardassians... the man who was truly    responsible for the massacre... Vedek    Bareil.,58A  INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
196,KIRA,   Do you really think I'm going to let    you get away with this?  No one's    going to believe the word of a    convicted traitor like Kubus.,62   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
197,WINN,   I never said I believed him either.     I'm only trying to protect the    spiritual life of Bajor.,62   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
198,KIRA,   Don't flatter yourself.  You're trying    to grab power.  Nothing more.,62   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
199,WINN,"   My child, do you want to risk the    consequences of having a collaborator    become the next Kai?",62   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
200,KIRA,   He's not a collaborator.,62   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
201,WINN,"   That's yet to be determined.  But if    he is chosen, and then turns out to    be guilty... the ramifications for    Bajor would be catastrophic.  It    would shatter faith in the authority    of the Kai.  And without a strong    Kai, Bajor can't survive.",62   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
202,KIRA,   But you can't condemn Bareil without    proof.,62   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
203,WINN,   I don't intend to.  I was planning    to conduct a quiet investigation    when I returned to Bajor.  But I    didn't know who to trust with such a    delicate assignment.  Until now.,62   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
204,KIRA,   You want me to do your dirty work    for you.,62   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
205,WINN,   All I care about is the truth.  And    I believe the Prophets have chosen    you to help me find it.,62   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
206,KIRA,   I'll find the truth.  Don't worry    about that.  But I want you to keep    Kubus's accusations from becoming    public until I've had a chance to    prove Bareil's innocence.,62   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
207,WINN,   You have my word.  Let the Prophets    be my witness.       But if you discover proof of his    guilt...,62   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
208,KIRA,"       Whatever I find out, I'll share with    you.",62   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
209,WINN,   Then it's decided.,62   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
210,WINN,"       Oh, and child, one last thing.  I    know you're under a terrible strain,    but if you're wise, you'll never    speak to me with such disrespect    again.",62   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine

212,KIRA,       You mean the massacre.,63   INT. DARKENED CARGO BAY,DARKENED CARGO BAY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
213,WINN,    (a slight reprimand     to Kira)   I think we all know what happened    that terrible day.,63   INT. DARKENED CARGO BAY,DARKENED CARGO BAY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
214,KIRA,   I just want to make sure he gets his    story straight.,63   INT. DARKENED CARGO BAY,DARKENED CARGO BAY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
215,KUBUS,"   Don't worry about that, Major.  Do    you think I could forget the deaths    of forty-three Bajorans, one of whom    was the Kai's son?",63   INT. DARKENED CARGO BAY,DARKENED CARGO BAY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
216,KIRA,   Were you aware at the time that Prylar    Bek was a collaborator?,63   INT. DARKENED CARGO BAY,DARKENED CARGO BAY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
217,KUBUS,"    (dismissive of the     idea)   He wasn't a collaborator.  He was    only a messenger between the    Cardassians and the Vedek Assembly.       But I could see in the weeks prior    to the massacre that something was    bothering him.  He was tense, nervous.     He was in constant communication    with someone in the Vedek Assembly.",63   INT. DARKENED CARGO BAY,DARKENED CARGO BAY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
218,KIRA,   Do you know who?,63   INT. DARKENED CARGO BAY,DARKENED CARGO BAY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
219,KUBUS,"   Not at the time... but the day after    the... incident, Vedek Bareil came    to visit him on the station.",63   INT. DARKENED CARGO BAY,DARKENED CARGO BAY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
220,KIRA,   You saw them together?,63   INT. DARKENED CARGO BAY,DARKENED CARGO BAY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
221,KUBUS,"   I saw Bareil enter Bek's quarters,    which were in the same section as    mine.  He was in there for a couple    of hours.  At times I heard shouting    through the bulkhead.",63   INT. DARKENED CARGO BAY,DARKENED CARGO BAY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
222,WINN,       Did you hear what they were saying?,63   INT. DARKENED CARGO BAY,DARKENED CARGO BAY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
223,KUBUS,   No.  But I did see Bareil when he    left the station.,63   INT. DARKENED CARGO BAY,DARKENED CARGO BAY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
224,KUBUS,"   He looked very upset.       The next morning, Bek hung himself.",63   INT. DARKENED CARGO BAY,DARKENED CARGO BAY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
225,KIRA,       That's all the evidence you have?,63   INT. DARKENED CARGO BAY,DARKENED CARGO BAY,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
226,KUBUS,"   Isn't that enough?  Bek was obviously    working with Bareil.  When he realized    the enormity of what he'd done, he    must've wanted to confess.

347,WINN,"       Oh, but I do.  Bareil just made a    surprise announcement to the Vedek    Assembly.  He's withdrawn himself    from the choosing.  He no longer    wishes to be the next Kai.",101  INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
348,WINN,"       I know this is painful for you, child.     But you've done all of Bajor a great    service.  Whoever is chosen tomorrow    as the new Kai will owe you a debt    of gratitude.       May the Prophets guide you.",101  INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
349,DAX,       Are you all right?,101  INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
350,KIRA,   It doesn't make sense.,101  INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
351,KIRA,   Bareil's an honorable man.  He    wouldn't hide from the consequences    of his actions by covering them up.       There's something I'm missing.,101  INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
352,KIRA,"   Chief, I need to get back into the    Vedek Assembly Archive.",101  INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
353,O'BRIEN,"       Yes, sir.",101  INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
354,KIRA,    (acknowledging Winn's     new title)   Kai Winn.,106  INT. TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
355,WINN,"   Your pagh is strong, my child.  Be    at peace.  In time you will learn I    am not your enemy.",106  INT. TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
356,KIRA,   I hope that's true.,106  INT. TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
357,WINN,"   I know you do.       Oh, and please tell Commander Sisko    that I'm going to have to postpone    appearing with him before the    Assembly.  At least, for now.",106  INT. TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
358,BAREIL,   Nerys... I didn't expect to see you    here.,106  INT. TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
359,KIRA,       You forgot to erase the transit files.,106  INT. TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
360,BAREIL,   I'm not sure I understand what you    mean.,106  INT. TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
361,KIRA,"   You did a wonderful job erasing the    transmission records, but you forgot    all about the transit files.  The    files that prove you weren't a    collaborator.",106  INT. TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
362,BAREIL,"   Let it rest, Nerys.  It's over now.     The people have chosen Winn.",106  INT. TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
363,KIRA,"   Only because you withdrew.  But you    didn't have to.  The transit records    clearly show that you were on a    personal retreat at the Dakeen    monastery during the week leading up    to the massacre.  I checked the Dakeen    transmission records and you had no    contact with anyone except for one    transmission after the massacre,    ordering you to return to the Vedek    Assembly.",106  INT. TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
364,BAREIL,"   That's enough, Nerys.",106  INT. TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
365,KIRA,   It's not enough.  There's no way you    could've ordered Bek to reveal the    location of the Kendra Valley    encampment.  You've been covering up    for someone else.  Someone who means    more to you than me.  More to you    even than becoming Kai.,106  INT. TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
366,BAREIL,"       Nerys, please, don't.",106  INT. TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
367,KIRA,   Why not?  It's the truth... isn't    it?  Who else meant that much to    you... It had to be Kai Opaka.    (a beat as she lets     it sink in)   Opaka knew where the resistance cell    was located because her son was a    member.,106  INT. TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
368,KIRA ,"   She was the collaborator, wasn't    she?",106  INT. TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
369,BAREIL,   She sacrificed her own son to save a    thousand people.       I had to protect her.,106  INT. TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
370,KIRA,"   So now instead of you, we have Winn    to lead us.",106  INT. TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
371,BAREIL,       It's the will of the Prophets...,106  INT. TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
372,KIRA,   The question is... where is she going    to lead us?,106  INT. TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
373,BAREIL,"   Down paths she can't possibly imagine.     And she's going to need our help    along the way, even if she doesn't    realize it yet.",106  INT. TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
374,KIRA,   And what happens to us?,106  INT. TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
375,BAREIL,   What do you want to happen?,106  INT. TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
376,KIRA,   Let's go pay our respects to the new    Kai.,106  INT. TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,TEMPLE ANTECHAMBER,INT.,,1994-03-21,Deep Space Nine
