312,THRAX,   It's been my observation that only    the guilty make that kind of    statement.,58   INT. TEROK NOR - SECURITY OFFICE,TEROK NOR,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1996-09-19,Deep Space Nine
313,ODO,   I didn't want to tell you this...    I don't know what the consequences   will be... but we're not    terrorists. We're not even    Bajorans. There's been a temporal    displacement of some kind. We're    from the future... we don't belong    in this time.,58   INT.

328,ODO,       Yes. I was chief of security on    the Promenade. I was the one who    charged those men with a crime    they didn't commit... and I was    the one who turned them over to    Dukat.,59   INT.

329,ODO,"       Three days after the executions,    there was another bombing on the    Promenade identical to the one    that almost killed Dukat. Timor,   Ishan and Jillur were innocent.       All the evidence was there... the    inconsistencies in the reports of   the soldiers who arrested them...    a pattern of other bombings... the    ballistics... it was all there    from the beginning... but I was    too busy... too concerned about   maintaining order... and the rule    of law.",59   INT.
