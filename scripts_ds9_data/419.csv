But I    knew how much more satisfying it    would be for you to find out for    yourself.  And believe me, Major;    that was my only deception.  Marritza?     He was a magnificent file clerk.     And I, Gul Darhe'el?  I hope you    won't think it immodest of me when I    say that I was a magnificent leader.     You never saw Gallitep at its    height.

When I was fighting with the    resistance, we used to lie awake at    night plotting the assassination of    men like him.

He saw    to it that I was provided with    information on all your little    terrorist bands.  I especially enjoyed    the termination reports.  You see,    life at a forced labor camp can be    so isolating.  At times I felt that    only I bore the burden of cleansing    Bajor of its rabble.
