229,DAX,   We need to talk.        I was looking over the sensor logs    from the crash and I came across    something odd -- the quantum    fluctuations in the barrier    factored out to zero.

244,YEDRIN,"   Look around you, Ben. Think of    all the things you've seen since    you got here. This is what your    crew and their descendents will    build if you let history play    itself out.

249,YEDRIN,   Jadzia knows what I'm talking    about. She's the one who insisted    the Defiant investigate this    planet.        You know as well as I do that you    should've been more careful... you    should've seen that the barrier    was unstable when you scanned it.,29   INT.

251,YEDRIN,"        And because of you, because of me --    Kira died, and forty-eight people    were stranded here. You don't    know what it was like to live with    that.        For years, every time I looked at    you, all I could think of was    Jake... and how because of me,    he'd never see his father again.    But eventually, I had to accept    the fact that there was nothing I    could do to change things. I    couldn't bring Kira back. All I    could do was look to the future.    And make sure we survived. No    matter what.        This community is my    responsibility. For two    centuries, I've watched it grow    into something to be proud of.
