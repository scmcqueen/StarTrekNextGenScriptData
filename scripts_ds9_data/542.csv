160,SLOAN,        That's odd. General Martok said    you were gone for seven days.,21   INT. WARDROOM ,WARDROOM ,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine

233,SLOAN,   Why? Because you felt sympathy    for them -- being genetically    engineered yourself?,27   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine
234,SISKO,   This is irrelevant. You're    talking about an incident that    took place before Doctor Bashir    allegedly became a Dominion agent.,27   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine
235,SLOAN,"   It's not irrelevant, Captain. If    anything, it shows that he was    already sympathetic to the    Dominion.",27   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine
236,SLOAN,"    (picking up another    PADD)   Let's move on.        Doctor, we spoke yesterday about    a group of genetically enhanced    patients that you brought to the    station. Why, exactly, did you    decide to work with them?",27   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine
237,BASHIR,   They'd been institutionalized most    of their lives. I thought I might    be able to help them assimilate    into society.,27   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine
238,SLOAN,"   A laudable goal. But what I find    puzzling is the way you went about    it. These misfits had been    sheltered from the outside world    for as long as they could    remember, yet you chose to bombard    them with information about the    war with the Dominion. Frankly,    I'm surprised it didn't scare them    into deeper isolation.",27   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine
239,BASHIR,   I was trying to engage them--- and    it worked.,27   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine
240,SLOAN,   Is that why you convinced    Starfleet Command to give them    access to classified battle plans?,27   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine
241,BASHIR,   Starfleet was interested in    hearing our ideas on how to win    the war.,27   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine
242,SLOAN,        How to win the war? You    recommended that the Federation    surrender!,27   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine
243,BASHIR,   We were looking for a way to save    as many lives as we could. If    you'd take the time to examine our    findings --,27   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine

245,SISKO,        I did.,27   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine
246,SLOAN,   Did you agree with them?,27   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine
247,SISKO,   No.,27   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine
248,SLOAN,   Of course not. No loyal Starfleet    officer could.,27   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine
249,SISKO,"   I won't deny that Doctor Bashir    has made some...    (choosing his words     carefully)    -- questionable decisions in his    career, but you're a long way from    convincing me he's a traitor. ",27   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine

252,SISKO,   That's a circular argument and you    know it.,27   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine
253,SLOAN,"   Captain, if Doctor Bashir had been    involved in one or two    questionable incidents, I can    understand how you might be able    to dismiss them.

254,SLOAN,   I understand that you want to be    loyal to a man who's served under    you for so long. I understand    that you're inclined to take his    word over that of an outsider.    But step back for a moment and    think about it. This man    concealed the truth about his    illegal genetic enhancement for    over thirty years. He lied to get    his medical license. He lied to    get into Starfleet. He lied to    you when he came aboard this    station and he's lied to you ever    since.,27   INT.

256,SLOAN,"   That's right, he did. But why?        What made you confess, Doctor?    Was it because you realized it was    your duty to be honest with your    captain?",27   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine
257,SLOAN,   Was it because you felt guilty    about having lied to him for so    long?,27   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine
258,BASHIR,        No.,27   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine
