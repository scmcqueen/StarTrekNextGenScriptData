233,SLOAN,   Why? Because you felt sympathy    for them -- being genetically    engineered yourself?,27   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,Inquisition,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine,542.txt
234,SISKO,   This is irrelevant. You're    talking about an incident that    took place before Doctor Bashir    allegedly became a Dominion agent.,27   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,Inquisition,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine,542.txt

236,SLOAN,"    (picking up another    PADD)   Let's move on.        Doctor, we spoke yesterday about    a group of genetically enhanced    patients that you brought to the    station.

238,SLOAN,"   A laudable goal. But what I find    puzzling is the way you went about    it. These misfits had been    sheltered from the outside world    for as long as they could    remember, yet you chose to bombard    them with information about the    war with the Dominion.

252,SISKO,   That's a circular argument and you    know it.,27   INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,Inquisition,1998-01-14,Deep Space Nine,542.txt
253,SLOAN,"   Captain, if Doctor Bashir had been    involved in one or two    questionable incidents, I can    understand how you might be able    to dismiss them.

254,SLOAN,   I understand that you want to be    loyal to a man who's served under    you for so long. I understand    that you're inclined to take his    word over that of an outsider.    But step back for a moment and    think about it. This man    concealed the truth about his    illegal genetic enhancement for    over thirty years. He lied to get    his medical license. He lied to    get into Starfleet. He lied to    you when he came aboard this    station and he's lied to you ever    since.,27   INT.
