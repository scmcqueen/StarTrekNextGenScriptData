111,COLLINS,   The training cruise was supposed    to last three months. We had    seven regular officers and a crew    of thirty-five cadets. The plan    was for the cadets to run the ship    while the officers observed and    critiqued our performance.,25   INT. VALIANT - SICKBAY,VALIANT,INT.,Valiant,1998-02-25,Deep Space Nine,546.txt
112,JAKE,"   So this was a training ship. Like    that other one... the, uh...    uh -- the Republic.",25   INT. VALIANT - SICKBAY,VALIANT,INT.,Valiant,1998-02-25,Deep Space Nine,546.txt
113,COLLINS,   Not quite. The Republic's an old    ship -- I don't think she's left    the Terran System in fifty years.    The Valiant's a state of the art    warship. Our mission was to    circumnavigate the entire    Federation before returning home.,25   INT. VALIANT - SICKBAY,VALIANT,INT.,Valiant,1998-02-25,Deep Space Nine,546.txt
114,JAKE,   The entire Federation? With a    ship of cadets?,25   INT. VALIANT - SICKBAY,VALIANT,INT.,Valiant,1998-02-25,Deep Space Nine,546.txt

116,JAKE,"   Look, I'm not trying to insult    anyone. Really. I'm actually    very impressed by what you've    done. I mean, you're my age and    I can barely work a food    replicator.

117,COLLINS,"   Well... the real credit should go    to Captain Watters. He's the one    that's kept us going.         He's never doubted us. Not once.    When things get tough -- and    things get tough a lot around    here -- he always finds a way to    push us through. He just looks    you in the eye and says, ""You can    do this... "" And somehow... you find    a way to do it.",25   INT. VALIANT - SICKBAY,VALIANT,INT.,Valiant,1998-02-25,Deep Space Nine,546.txt

119,COLLINS,"   We're all supposed to be    leaders -- that's what the Academy    trains us to be. No, Tim Watters    is more than that, he's...        ... he's the captain.",25   INT. VALIANT - SICKBAY,VALIANT,INT.,Valiant,1998-02-25,Deep Space Nine,546.txt
120,WATTERS,"   We were transiting the Kepla    Sector when the war broke out.    As you probably know, a Dominion    invasion force swept through that    sector on the first day.",26   INT. VALIANT - READY ROOM,VALIANT,INT.,Valiant,1998-02-25,Deep Space Nine,546.txt
121,NOG,   So you were caught behind enemy    lines?,26   INT. VALIANT - READY ROOM,VALIANT,INT.,Valiant,1998-02-25,Deep Space Nine,546.txt
122,WATTERS,"   Correct. We were trying to make    our way back to Federation-held    space when we encountered a    Cardassian battle cruiser near    El-Gatark. It was our first taste    of combat.        In the first fifteen minutes, four    regular officers were killed and    three others were critically    wounded... including Captain    Ramirez.",26   INT.

123,NOG,   Is that when you took command?,26   INT. VALIANT - READY ROOM,VALIANT,INT.,Valiant,1998-02-25,Deep Space Nine,546.txt
124,WATTERS,"   No. When I got to the bridge, the    captain was in pretty bad shape    but he was lucid and refused to    go to Sickbay. We'd lost main    power and were adrift, but the    Cardassian cruiser was no better    off. So it was a race against the    clock -- the ship that got main    power back on-line first would    have a decisive advantage.        The captain was... amazing. He    directed the entire damage control    effort with a punctured lung and    massive internal injuries.       He was a great man.",26   INT. VALIANT - READY ROOM,VALIANT,INT.,Valiant,1998-02-25,Deep Space Nine,546.txt
125,NOG,   And he won the race.,26   INT. VALIANT - READY ROOM,VALIANT,INT.,Valiant,1998-02-25,Deep Space Nine,546.txt
126,WATTERS,"   We got weapons and impulse engines    back on-line within three hours.    And we destroyed that Cardie ship.         The next day, just before he died,    the captain ordered me to take    command of the Valiant.",26   INT. VALIANT - READY ROOM,VALIANT,INT.,Valiant,1998-02-25,Deep Space Nine,546.txt
127,NOG,   It's... unbelievable. You've    spent eight months behind enemy    lines.,26   INT. VALIANT - READY ROOM,VALIANT,INT.,Valiant,1998-02-25,Deep Space Nine,546.txt
128,WATTERS,   I didn't do it alone. The crew    deserves the real credit. We have    cadets here as young as seventeen    who're doing the jobs of officers    twice their age.,26   INT. VALIANT - READY ROOM,VALIANT,INT.,Valiant,1998-02-25,Deep Space Nine,546.txt

144,WATTERS,"   No. We've had to maintain strict    radio silence ever since the war    began. The orders were addressed    to Captain Ramirez, but since he's    dead, the mission is now mine.
