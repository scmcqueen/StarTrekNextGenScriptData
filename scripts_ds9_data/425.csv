386,GUL DUKAT,   Is there a question?,54   INT. SCHOOLROOM,SCHOOLROOM,INT.,Cardassians,1993-08-16,Deep Space Nine,425.txt
387,BASHIR,   The question is whether or not this    officer might have deliberately left    the son of Kotan Pa'Dar at the    relocation center... with full    knowledge that he was not an orphan.     Perhaps with the hopes of humiliating    Pa'Dar someday.,54   INT. SCHOOLROOM,SCHOOLROOM,INT.,Cardassians,1993-08-16,Deep Space Nine,425.txt

394,SISKO ,"   Station log, Stardate 47178.3.  After    long and difficult deliberations, I    have decided to allow Pa'Dar to take    his son back to Cardassia.  Although    I am convinced his Bajoran foster    parents treated him with love, Rugal    has been the clear victim in this    conspiracy.  I believe it's time for    his healing to begin.",55   EXT.
