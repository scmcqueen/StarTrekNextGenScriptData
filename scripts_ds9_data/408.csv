328,DAX,"   I won't discuss it with you and I    won't discuss it in the witness chair.     As for Enina Tandro, yes, I feel the    shame for Curzon's indiscretions.     When one of my kind stumbles,    Benjamin... it's a mistake that's    there forever.  I can't tell you    which part of Curzon Dax couldn't    stop himself from acting shamefully    with another man's wife.  I can tell    you he did love her, for whatever    that's worth.",85   INT.

333,RENORA,"   Lieutenant Dax... You're either two    hundred years older than I am... or    you're about the same age as my great    granddaughter.  At first I wondered    which of those you were.
