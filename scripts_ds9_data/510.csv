23,BASHIR,   What you need is a stretching    regimen. Worf's morning exercise    class would be just the thing.,2    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1996-10-30,Deep Space Nine
24,QUARK,   Forget that. I've got a holosuite    program that'll take care of him.    Three Orion slave girls strap you    into a --,2    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1996-10-30,Deep Space Nine

53,ODO,   To find out if the species they    encountered posed any threat.    What better way to gauge another    race than to see how it treats the    weak and vulnerable?,4    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1996-10-30,Deep Space Nine
54,SISKO,   I see your point.,4    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1996-10-30,Deep Space Nine
55,ODO,   Several months. Why?,4    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1996-10-30,Deep Space Nine
56,SISKO,   There's a lot about your people we    still don't know. The changeling    could provide Starfleet with    invaluable information about the    Dominion.,4    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1996-10-30,Deep Space Nine
57,ODO,"   That being the case, I'd like to    be allowed to work with it --    teach it how to shape-shift.",4    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1996-10-30,Deep Space Nine
58,SISKO,   I can't think of anyone better    qualified.       But you might want a little help.   Maybe you should contact Doctor    Mora.,4    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1996-10-30,Deep Space Nine

61,ODO,   Maybe so. But I'd prefer to do    this alone.,4    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1996-10-30,Deep Space Nine
62,SISKO,   It's your call.       But it's always nice to have    someone around to help change the    diapers.,4    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1996-10-30,Deep Space Nine
63,ODO,       I'll keep that in mind...,4    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1996-10-30,Deep Space Nine
64,BASHIR,   The purge was nearly a hundred    percent effective -- the    concentration of isotopes is    almost negligible.,7    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1996-10-30,Deep Space Nine
65,ODO,   It certainly looks healthier...,7    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1996-10-30,Deep Space Nine
66,BASHIR,   I'd better go check on Kira. Did    you hear? She's in labor.,7    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1996-10-30,Deep Space Nine
67,ODO,       Mm-mm...,7    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1996-10-30,Deep Space Nine
68,BASHIR,       I guess you've got your own baby    to think about.,7    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1996-10-30,Deep Space Nine
69,BASHIR,   There's still a small degree of    instability in its morphogenic    matrix. I'm hoping it'll level    out. I set the computer to    monitor for biomimetic    fluctuations just in case.,7    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1996-10-30,Deep Space Nine
70,ODO,"   Thank you, Doctor.",7    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1996-10-30,Deep Space Nine

72,ODO,       How do you feel -- better?,7    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1996-10-30,Deep Space Nine
73,ODO,"   I realize you can't understand a    word I'm saying, but that doesn't    matter. I know you're aware of    me. You see, I was once like you.    I spent months in a lab being    poked and prodded by a scientist    who didn't even realize I was a    lifeform. I was just a specimen,    a mystery that needed to be    unraveled. He never talked to me.    It didn't occur to him. I didn't    know what I was, or what I was    supposed to do. I was lost,    alone.",7    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1996-10-30,Deep Space Nine

Once I did it, and he    turned the infernal thing off, I    was perfectly content to stay a    cube for hours. It was    fascinating -- all those right    angles. of course, he had other    plans.
