337,KIRA,   No. But this isn't about what I    want... or what you want. This is    about Captain Sisko. And he told    us he doesn't want anything to    interfere with his visions.,51   INT. SURGERY,SURGERY,INT.,Rapture,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine,508.txt
338,WHATLEY,"   Major, these visions may be    important, but I think we're all    in agreement here that they're not   as important as Captain Sisko's life.       Start the procedure.",51   INT. SURGERY,SURGERY,INT.,Rapture,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine,508.txt

340,BASHIR ,       Captain Sisko refused surgery.    And I can't go against the    decision of my patient.       Not without the consent of his    closest relative.,51   INT. SURGERY,SURGERY,INT.,Rapture,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine,508.txt

348,KIRA,   It wasn't the Federation. It was    his son. And he had every right    to make that decision.,53   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,Rapture,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine,508.txt
349,WINN,   It was a selfish act.,53   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,Rapture,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine,508.txt
350,KIRA,   He's an eighteen-year-old boy who    doesn't want to lose his father.    What would you have done in his    place?,53   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,Rapture,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine,508.txt
351,WINN,   I would have trusted the Prophets.,53   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,Rapture,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine,508.txt

353,KIRA ,   Maybe they've already told Captain   Sisko everything they want him to    know.,53   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,Rapture,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine,508.txt
354,WINN,   Perhaps.       I suppose you've heard...       Bajor will not be joining the    Federation today. The Council of    Ministers have voted to delay    acceptance of Federation    membership.,53   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,Rapture,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine,508.txt
355,KIRA,   You must be very pleased.,53   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,Rapture,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine,508.txt
356,WINN,"   I wish I were. But things aren't    so simple. Not anymore. Before    Captain Sisko found B'hala, my   path was clear. I knew who my    enemies were... but now... now    nothing is certain.",53   INT. PROMENADE,PROMENADE,INT.,Rapture,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine,508.txt

367,SISKO,"       I can't do that. The visions may    have faded, but everything I said,    everything I did, still feels    right.
