131,KIRA,   Looks can be deceiving. But you    don't need me to tell you that.,24   INT. AIRLOCK,AIRLOCK,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
132,WINN,   Why isn't the Emissary here to    greet me?,24   INT. AIRLOCK,AIRLOCK,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
133,KIRA,   I'm afraid Captain Sisko is busy    at the moment.,24   INT. AIRLOCK,AIRLOCK,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
134,WINN,   No doubt he's still basking in the    adulation of Starfleet Command.,24   INT. AIRLOCK,AIRLOCK,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
135,KIRA,   Something like that.,24   INT. AIRLOCK,AIRLOCK,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
136,WINN,   I'm sure the Federation is very    pleased with the job he's done.,24   INT. AIRLOCK,AIRLOCK,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
137,KIRA,       I thought everyone was.,24   INT. AIRLOCK,AIRLOCK,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
138,WINN,"   Not everyone.       Our culture has only had five    short years to recover from the    Occupation. Only five years of    freedom. Hardly seems enough    time, does it?",24   INT. AIRLOCK,AIRLOCK,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
139,KIRA,   Bajor will still be free. Joining    the Federation won't change that.,24   INT. AIRLOCK,AIRLOCK,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
140,WINN,   I see working beside Captain Sisko    all these years has had quite an    influence on you.,24   INT. AIRLOCK,AIRLOCK,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
141,KIRA,   I have to give you credit. You    never give up.       I'm sure the Emissary will    consider everything you have to   say. And then Bajor's admittance    can go forward... unobstructed.,24   INT. AIRLOCK,AIRLOCK,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
142,WINN,   I await the will of the Prophets.,24   INT. AIRLOCK,AIRLOCK,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
143,KASIDY ,"   Hello, Ben.",25   INT. HOLOSUITE,HOLOSUITE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
144,SISKO,       Kasidy.,25   INT. HOLOSUITE,HOLOSUITE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
145,KASIDY,   Jake said I could find you...,25   INT. HOLOSUITE,HOLOSUITE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
146,SISKO,   Something wrong?,25   INT. HOLOSUITE,HOLOSUITE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
147,KASIDY,   Not at all. I'm just a little    surprised. I wasn't sure you'd be    happy to see me.,25   INT. HOLOSUITE,HOLOSUITE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
148,SISKO,   What are you doing for the next    few hours?,25   INT. HOLOSUITE,HOLOSUITE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
149,KASIDY,   I don't know. I just got here.,25   INT. HOLOSUITE,HOLOSUITE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
150,SISKO,   Why don't you come to Bajor with    me?,25   INT. HOLOSUITE,HOLOSUITE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
151,KASIDY,   Right now?,25   INT. HOLOSUITE,HOLOSUITE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
152,SISKO,   I think I know where to find   B'hala.       The sacred lost city of Bajor.,25   INT. HOLOSUITE,HOLOSUITE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
153,SISKO,"   You see these markings? They're    a coordinate system keyed to the    position of the stars at a certain    time of night...       You don't have the faintest idea    what I'm talking about, do you?",25   INT. HOLOSUITE,HOLOSUITE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
154,KASIDY,   Not a clue.,25   INT. HOLOSUITE,HOLOSUITE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
155,SISKO,   Come to Bajor and I'll show you.,25   INT. HOLOSUITE,HOLOSUITE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
156,KASIDY,   I'm not even sure where I'm    staying yet.,25   INT. HOLOSUITE,HOLOSUITE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
157,SISKO,   You can have your old quarters    back... if you want them.,25   INT. HOLOSUITE,HOLOSUITE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
158,KASIDY,   They're still available?,25   INT. HOLOSUITE,HOLOSUITE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
159,SISKO,   Everything's just the way you left    it. I have some pull with the    station's C.O.,25   INT. HOLOSUITE,HOLOSUITE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
160,KASIDY,       Ben.,25   INT. HOLOSUITE,HOLOSUITE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
161,KASIDY,       I've missed you.,25   INT. HOLOSUITE,HOLOSUITE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
162,SISKO,   I'm glad you're back.        Now what do you say we go find    B'hala?,25   INT. HOLOSUITE,HOLOSUITE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
163,,   Now what do you say we go find    B'hala?,25   INT. HOLOSUITE,HOLOSUITE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
164,KASIDY,"   Somehow, I don't think you're    going to take ""no"" for an answer.",25   INT. HOLOSUITE,HOLOSUITE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
165,SISKO,   This way.,27   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
166,KASIDY,"   We must be two hundred meters    underground. I don't want to be    negative, Ben... but this doesn't    look like a lost city to me.",27   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
167,SISKO,   What you're looking at is twenty    thousand years worth of sediment.        Stay close and watch your step.    We're not far from --,27   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
168,KASIDY,   What's the matter?,27   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
169,SISKO,   It's nothing. I'll be fine in a    second. Julian said headaches    might be a side effect of the    accident.,27   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
170,KASIDY,"   What about obsessing over an    ancient Bajoran city? Is that a    side effect, too?",27   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
171,SISKO,   You're being negative again.,27   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
172,SISKO,   C'mon -- it's right around the    bend.,27   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
173,KASIDY,   What is it?,27   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
174,SISKO,   It's B'hala.,27   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
175,KASIDY,"   Ben, it's a wall of stone.",27   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
176,SISKO,   But what's behind the wall?,27   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
177,WORF,   Those quarters are not appropriate    for Admiral Colti. She outranks    Admiral Veta.,33   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
178,ODO,"   Then let's put her in H-Two, Veta    goes to D-Nine, and Rifkin in K-   Four.",33   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
179,ODO,   But he's only a captain.,33   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
180,WORF,   It's a naval tradition.,33   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
181,ODO,"   So is keelhauling. But right now,    we should focus on accommodations.",33   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
182,ODO,"   Don't you agree, major?",33   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
183,KIRA,   Hmm?,33   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
184,ODO,"       Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt    your reverie.",33   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
185,KIRA,   I was just thinking about Captain    Sisko finding B'hala. Bajoran    archaeologists have been searching    for the sacred city for ten    thousand years. And he found it    in a few days.,33   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
186,ODO,   Or he made a very lucky guess.,33   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
187,KIRA,       It was a sign. A sign from the    Prophets.,33   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
188,ODO,   I wonder if the Prophets can help    us find quarters for Captain Rifkin.,33   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
189,KIRA,   Of course.       Good luck.,33   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
190,ODO,       I was about to say the same to    you.,33   INT. SECURITY OFFICE,SECURITY OFFICE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
191,WINN,"   My child, you and the Emissary    are... close, are you not?",34   INT. PROMENADE - UPPER LEVEL,PROMENADE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
192,KIRA,   I consider Captain Sisko a friend.,34   INT. PROMENADE - UPPER LEVEL,PROMENADE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
193,WINN,   So you know his mind. How he    thinks... how he reacts in    certain situations...,34   INT. PROMENADE - UPPER LEVEL,PROMENADE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
194,KIRA,   I'm not really sure what you're    asking.,34   INT. PROMENADE - UPPER LEVEL,PROMENADE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
195,WINN,   I'm asking if you think the    Emissary will forgive me.,34   INT. PROMENADE - UPPER LEVEL,PROMENADE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
196,KIRA,   Forgive you?,34   INT. PROMENADE - UPPER LEVEL,PROMENADE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
197,WINN,   For doubting him.       He must be aware that I never    truly believed he was the    Emissary.,34   INT. PROMENADE - UPPER LEVEL,PROMENADE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
198,KIRA,       I'm sure it crossed his mind.,34   INT. PROMENADE - UPPER LEVEL,PROMENADE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
199,WINN,       I was wrong. I know that now.    only someone touched by the    Prophets could find B'hala.,34   INT. PROMENADE - UPPER LEVEL,PROMENADE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
200,KIRA,   Does this mean you're not going to    try to block Bajor's admittance    into the Federation?,34   INT. PROMENADE - UPPER LEVEL,PROMENADE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
201,WINN,   I will follow the path the    Emissary has laid out for us.,34   INT. PROMENADE - UPPER LEVEL,PROMENADE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
202,KIRA,"   I have to admit, I'm surprised to    hear that. It takes a lot of    courage to admit you're wrong.",34   INT. PROMENADE - UPPER LEVEL,PROMENADE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
203,WINN,   And you think I lack courage?,34   INT. PROMENADE - UPPER LEVEL,PROMENADE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
204,KIRA,   I didn't say that.,34   INT. PROMENADE - UPPER LEVEL,PROMENADE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
205,WINN,   But it is what you think.       Those of you who were in the    Resistance -- you're all the same.    You think you're the only ones who    fought the Cardassians... that you   saved Bajor singlehandedly.,34   INT. PROMENADE - UPPER LEVEL,PROMENADE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
206,WINN,"   Perhaps you forget, major, that    the Cardassians arrested any    Bajoran they found teaching the    word of the Prophets. I spent    five years in a Cardassian prison    camp... I can remember each and    every beating that I suffered.    And where you had weapons to    protect yourself, all I had was my    faith... and my courage.       Walk with the Prophets, child. I    know I will.",34   INT. PROMENADE - UPPER LEVEL,PROMENADE,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine

210,SISKO,       B'hala.,37   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
211,WHATLEY,   Missing for twenty thousand years    and you found it. Pretty    impressive.       Sure as hell impressed the    Bajorans. How'd you know where to    look?,37   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
212,SISKO,   You might say it came to me in a    vision.,37   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
213,WHATLEY,   I know that's what the Bajorans    think. But just between you and    me... what really happened?,37   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
214,SISKO,"   I know it's hard to understand...    but it really was a vision.       For the last few days, I've been    having these moments of insight...    flashes of understanding.",37   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
215,WHATLEY,   And they started after you had the   accident?,37   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
216,WHATLEY,"   I don't know, Ben. This is a    little strange.",37   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
217,SISKO,"   You didn't come down here to see    B'hala, did you, Admiral?",37   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
218,WHATLEY,   No. I came to see you. I was    surprised you weren't on the    station when I arrived.,37   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
219,SISKO,   I'm sorry about that.,37   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
220,WHATLEY,   Not sorry enough to return my com    signals... all three of them... ,37   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
221,WHATLEY,"   Ben, I need to know I can count on    you. Bajor's admission is only    the beginning. Now comes the hard    part Federation council members    have to be chosen... the Bajoran    militia has to be absorbed into    Starfleet... there are thousands    of details that have to be    overseen. And you're our point    man here. That means we need to    depend on you more than ever.",37   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine

223,WHATLEY,"   I'm glad to here that. Now, what    do you say we get back up to the    station?",37   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
224,SISKO,   I can't go back to the station.    Not just yet.,37   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
225,WHATLEY,   Why not? I'm sure the Bajorans    can take it from here. Or were    you thinking of digging up the    entire city all by yourself?,37   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
226,SISKO,"   Charlie, I just need a little more    time.",37   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine

231,WHATLEY,"   All right, I'll give you some    time. But I want you back on the    station by oh-seven-hundred hours,    tomorrow. You're to report to    Doctor Bashir for a complete    physical.",37   INT. CAVES,CAVES,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine

241,BASHIR,   He didn't have much choice. The    Bajorans are deeply committed to    their spirituality... not to    mention incredibly stubborn.

263,SISKO,   I was on Bajor. B'hala had been    rebuilt. The streets were filled    with people... celebrating. ,44   INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1996-10-11,Deep Space Nine
