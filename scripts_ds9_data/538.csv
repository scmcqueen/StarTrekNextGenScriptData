384,PABST,   There is no magazine. Not this    month anyway. Mister Stone had    the entire run pulped.,68   INT. MAGAZINE OFFICE - DAY,MAGAZINE OFFICE,INT.,,1997-11-14,Deep Space Nine
385,BENNY,   He can't do that!,68   INT. MAGAZINE OFFICE - DAY,MAGAZINE OFFICE,INT.,,1997-11-14,Deep Space Nine
386,PABST,   He can and he did. He believes    that this issue quote -- did not    meet our usual high standards --    unquote.,68   INT. MAGAZINE OFFICE - DAY,MAGAZINE OFFICE,INT.,,1997-11-14,Deep Space Nine
