By    the time I became Prefect, the    occupation had been going on for    almost forty years, but the planet    was still not ready for full-scale    colonization.

230,DUKAT,"   So in my first official act as    Prefect, I ordered all labor camp    commanders to reduce their output    quotas by fifty percent -- fifty    percent! Then I reorganized the    camps themselves. Child labor was    abolished. Medical care was    improved and food rations were    increased. In the first month of    my administration, the death rate    dropped by more than twenty    percent.        And how did the Bajorans react?    On my one month anniversary they    blew up an orbital drydock,    killing over two hundred    Cardassian soldiers and workers.",57   INT.

244,DUKAT,"        Because they were blind, ignorant    fools. They couldn't see that if    they had only chosen to cooperate    with us, we could've turned their    world into a paradise.         From the moment we arrived on    Bajor, it was clear that we were    the superior race. But they    couldn't accept that.

But no... day after day they    clustered in their temples and    prayed for deliverance, and night    after night they planted bombs    outside our homes.        Pride. That's what it was.    Stubborn, unyielding pride.
