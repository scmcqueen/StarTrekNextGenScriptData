323,KIRA,   We've got about ten minutes before    the main reactor core overloads and    destroys the station.  The only way    to stop it is to disengage the laser    fusion initiator at one of the control    junctions on Level Thirty-four.  But    the turbolifts and transporters are    off line.,35   INT.
