473,BASHIR,"        What do you make of that, Jack?    Why didn't you anticipate it --    why didn't you factor her into    your equations?",41   INT. CARGO BAY/TEAM DORM,CARGO BAY/TEAM DORM,INT.,Statistical Probabilities,1997-09-26,Deep Space Nine,533.txt

475,BASHIR,"   One person derailed your plans.    One person changed the course of    history.        I don't know about you, but that    gives me hope.

477,O'BRIEN,   It was a pretty close call.,42A  INT. QUARK'S ,QUARK'S ,INT.,Statistical Probabilities,1997-09-26,Deep Space Nine,533.txt
478,BASHIR,   Luckily Odo managed to intercept    them in time.,42A  INT. QUARK'S ,QUARK'S ,INT.,Statistical Probabilities,1997-09-26,Deep Space Nine,533.txt

480,O'BRIEN,   I'm talking about when you had to    decide whether or not to meet with    the Dominion. I'm sure it wasn't    easy -- I know you wanted to try    to save as many lives as possible.         It's probably what makes you such    a good doctor.,42A  INT.

482,BASHIR,"   We thought we were so smart. We    actually believed we could predict    the future.         It's my fault, not theirs. I    should never have let things go so    far. I guess I was just too bent    on proving to the world that they    have something to contribute.",42A  INT. QUARK'S ,QUARK'S ,INT.,Statistical Probabilities,1997-09-26,Deep Space Nine,533.txt
483,O'BRIEN,"   They did contribute, Julian.         Seems to me we were starting to    get a little too complacent about    the Dominion. We may have driven    them back into Cardassian space,    but that doesn't mean we've beaten    them.",42A  INT. QUARK'S ,QUARK'S ,INT.,Statistical Probabilities,1997-09-26,Deep Space Nine,533.txt
