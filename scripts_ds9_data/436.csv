0,DAX ,"   Science Officer's Log, Stardate    47603.3.  Commander Sisko has assigned    me to investigate an unusual particle    field detected on the other side of    the wormhole.  Odo has come along as    he often does on Gamma Quadrant    missions, hoping to find a clue to    his origin.",1    EXT. RUNABOUT (OPTICAL),RUNABOUT,EXT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
1,DAX,"   So you see... Ensign Manwaring has    spent the last two weeks avoiding    the assay office because he thought    that Freyla was in love with    Lieutenant Strek, but all the time,    Strek was seeing Security Officer    Seelee and Freyla was waiting for    Manwaring to ask her out.",2    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
2,ODO,   Officer Seelee has seemed...    distracted at work lately.       I'm going to have to talk to her    about this when I get back to the    station.,2    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
3,DAX,"       Odo, I didn't tell you that story to    get Seelee in trouble.",2    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
4,ODO,"   Frankly, Lieutenant, I fail to see    any point in your story at all, except    perhaps to illustrate the foolish    humanoid preoccupation with romantic    coupling.",2    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
5,DAX,   The point of the story is that    sometimes we don't recognize true    love even when it's staring us right    in the face.,2    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
6,ODO,       How fascinating.,2    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt

10,ODO,   She has a cousin who's interested in    a career in law enforcement.,2    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
11,DAX,    (not believing that     excuse for a second)   You don't say.,2    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
12,ODO,   Are you implying that Lysia Arlin is    interested in me?,2    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
13,ODO,   Ridiculous... I would have noticed.,2    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
14,DAX,       Exactly my point.,2    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
15,ODO,   You must be mistaken.,2    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
16,DAX,   How can you be so sure?,2    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
17,ODO,   Because women don't react to me in    that manner.,2    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
18,DAX,       Are you telling me that you've never    had a... female friend?,2    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
19,ODO,   I consider Major Kira a friend.,2    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
20,DAX,   That isn't what I meant.  I'm talking    about... an intimate friendship.,2    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
21,ODO,   That's a very personal question.,2    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt

25,DAX,   Looks like we found that particle    field.       They're Omicron particles.,2    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
26,ODO,   Is that unusual?,2    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
27,DAX,   Omicron particles are incredibly    rare.  They can only be created by    certain types of matter/anti-matter    reactions.       The field seems to be coming from    the second planet in this system.     Let's go in a little closer.,2    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
28,DAX,   That's strange.  The particles are    concentrated in one small valley.     And look at these field    fluctuations...,4    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
29,ODO,       Totally non-random.,4    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
30,DAX,   Someone or something must be    manipulating the field.,4    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
31,ODO,   Sensors aren't picking up any life    forms.,4    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
32,DAX,   The particle field could be    interfering with the sensors.       We'd better beam down and take a    look.,4    INT. RUNABOUT,RUNABOUT,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
33,DAX,   I'm still getting a lot of    interference.  The particle field    must be blocking the tricorder    functions.,5    EXT. YOSHADRAN SETTLEMENT - NIGHT,YOSHADRAN SETTLEMENT,EXT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
34,DAX,   The interference seems to be coming    from here.       This must be the source of the field.     It's probably some kind of matter/anti-   matter reactor.,5    EXT. YOSHADRAN SETTLEMENT - NIGHT,YOSHADRAN SETTLEMENT,EXT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt

45,KIRA,   I wondered the same thing myself.     So I did some checking.  Your cousin's    wanted for robbing a museum on    Cardassia Five.  My guess is that he    thought someone here would help him    sell the merchandise.,7    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,Shadowplay,1993-12-09,Deep Space Nine,436.txt
