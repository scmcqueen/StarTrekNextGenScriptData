2,SISKO,   Looks like the festival was a   success.,1    INT. BAJORAN SHRINE,BAJORAN SHRINE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
3,KIRA,"   Everyone seemed to enjoy it.        Thank you, captain.",1    INT. BAJORAN SHRINE,BAJORAN SHRINE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
4,SISKO,   For what?,1    INT. BAJORAN SHRINE,BAJORAN SHRINE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
5,KIRA,   For insisting that the festival    take place in spite of the fact    that we're in the middle of a    war.,1    INT. BAJORAN SHRINE,BAJORAN SHRINE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
6,SISKO,   War or no war -- we have a lot    to be grateful for. It's    important to remember that.,1    INT. BAJORAN SHRINE,BAJORAN SHRINE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
7,KIRA,"   Yes, it is.        Shouldn't you be heading over to    the wardroom for the ceremony?",1    INT. BAJORAN SHRINE,BAJORAN SHRINE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
8,SISKO,   I'm on my way.,1    INT. BAJORAN SHRINE,BAJORAN SHRINE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
9,ODO,   Nerys -- I've been looking for    you.,1    INT. BAJORAN SHRINE,BAJORAN SHRINE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
10,KIRA,   I don't really feel like talking    to you right now.,1    INT. BAJORAN SHRINE,BAJORAN SHRINE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
11,ODO,   Don't you want to hear my side    of the story?,1    INT. BAJORAN SHRINE,BAJORAN SHRINE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
12,KIRA,   No.,1    INT. BAJORAN SHRINE,BAJORAN SHRINE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
13,ODO,        Somebody has to maintain order    on the Promenade.,1    INT. BAJORAN SHRINE,BAJORAN SHRINE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
14,ODO,"   I'd hardly call it an arrest --   he wasn't in the holding cell    for more than an hour. Besides,    he was breaking the law.     Fundraising on the Promenade    without a license is strictly    forbidden. Station regulation    fifteen-twenty-six, paragraph    seven--",1    INT. BAJORAN SHRINE,BAJORAN SHRINE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
15,KIRA,        Vedek Solis was collecting    donations for Bajoran flood    victims!,1    INT. BAJORAN SHRINE,BAJORAN SHRINE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
16,ODO,"   A very worthy cause.    Nevertheless, station    regulations are quite clear --",1    INT. BAJORAN SHRINE,BAJORAN SHRINE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
17,KIRA,        I don't care about station    regulations.,1    INT. BAJORAN SHRINE,BAJORAN SHRINE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
18,ODO,        Is that the Orb of Contemplation?,1    INT. BAJORAN SHRINE,BAJORAN SHRINE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine

23,DAX,    (with a twinkle in     her eyes)    And to think... I knew him when    he was just a callow youth.,2    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
24,O'BRIEN,   I bet even then he showed signs    of greatness.,2    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
25,DAX,        Only with the ladies.,2    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
26,JAKE,        I'd like to hear more about    that.,2    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
27,WORF,   Then let him tell you.,2    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
28,DAX,        But he'll leave out all the good    parts.,2    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
29,ROSS,"   The medal usually comes with a    lot more pomp and ceremony, but    we figured you wouldn't want to    be called back to Earth just to    sit through a bad chicken dinner    with a bunch of brass hats.",2    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
30,SISKO,"   This suits me fine, admiral.",2    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
31,DAX,   Now you have something else to    put on your desk besides that    baseball.,2    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
32,WORF,"   What she means to say, captain,    is that she can't think of    anyone more deserving of this    honor.",2    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
33,O'BRIEN,   I certainly can't.,2    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
34,JAKE,"   I'm proud of you, Dad.",2    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
35,ROSS,"        If you'd excuse us, I'd like a    word with Captain Sisko.",2    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
36,ROSS,"   I've got good news for you,    captain. Starfleet Command has    decided we've been waging a    defensive war long enough. They    figure we're never going to win    this thing unless we take the    fight into Dominion territory.",2    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
37,ROSS,"        I know, you've been saying that    ever since the Romulans opened a    second front against the    Dominion. It took a while, but    your message finally got    through.",2    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
38,SISKO,   When do we go?,2    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
39,ROSS,        That all depends on you.,2    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
40,SISKO,   Me?,2    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
41,ROSS,"   That's right, Ben. Starfleet    has chosen you to plan the    invasion of Cardassia.",2    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
42,BASHIR ,   Finally.,6    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
43,BASHIR,   I've been waiting for you to get    out of that holosuite for twenty    minutes.,6    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
44,DAX,"   Sorry, Julian. We lost track of    the time.",6    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
45,BASHIR,        Doing what? You were supposed    to be in there exercising. I    don't see any sweat. Where are    the bruises? The broken bones?    The blood?,6    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
46,WORF,   We were... talking.,6    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
47,QUARK,   For an hour and forty-five    minutes?,6    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
48,WORF,   It's a private matter.,6    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
49,DAX,        We're thinking about having a baby.,6    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
50,WORF,        It was a private matter.,6    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
51,SISKO ,   Sisko to Commander Worf. Please    report to my office immediately.,6    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
52,WORF,   Acknowledged.,6    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
53,DAX,   You're both awfully quiet.,6    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
54,BASHIR,"   I don't want to dampen your    spirits, but I told you before    you got married that, medically    speaking, it wouldn't be easy    for a Trill and a Klingon to    have a child.",6    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
55,QUARK,   And I'm worried the kid will end    up looking like his father.,6    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
56,DAX,        I hope she does.,6    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
57,BASHIR,        A baby?,6    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
58,QUARK,   It's bad enough she married that    Klingon psychopath.,6    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
59,BASHIR,"   A baby... you know what this    means, don't you?",6    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
60,QUARK,        Their marriage is going to last    longer than we thought.,6    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
61,WORF,"   What about the Torg'Q system?    Of all the targets along the    border, it's the closest to    Cardassia Prime.",8    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
62,GARAK,   It's also the most heavily    fortified.,8    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
63,WORF,   True.        But that could work to our    advantage. The Dominion will    never expect us to attack there.,8    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
64,O'BRIEN,        The element of surprise might    give us an initial advantage...    but I'm not sure how long it    would last. And I don't even    want to think about our casualty    figures...,8    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
65,GARAK,"   I recommend the Ventani System.    I know it's a long way from    Cardassia Prime, but its second    planet was the birthplace of    Tret Akleen -- the father of the    Cardassian Empire. ",8    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
66,GARAK ,   To lose such sacred ground would    be devastating to Cardassians    everywhere. And a great    propaganda victory for you.,8    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
67,WORF,"   Even so, there is little    strategic value in holding the    Ventani System.",8    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
68,SISKO,   And its loss would have no    effect on the Jem'Hadar.,8    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
69,GARAK,   True.,8    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
70,SISKO,"   Something on your mind, Chief?",8    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
71,O'BRIEN,"   What about the Chin'toka System,    sir?",8    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
72,WORF,   The Chin'toka System is    protected by a fleet of Dominion    ships.,8    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
73,O'BRIEN,"   The last time we patrolled that    section of the border, I noticed    something strange about the warp    signatures of their bigger    ships... the cruisers, the    destroyers...",8    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
74,SISKO,        Go on.,8    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
75,O'BRIEN,   They were slightly different    from the first time we scanned    them. The field variance    readings seemed almost too    synchronized.,8    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
76,SISKO,   Are you suggesting that the warp    signatures are fake? That those    ships are no longer there?,8    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
77,O'BRIEN,   It's possible.,8    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
78,WORF,   Why would the Dominion pull so    many of their ships away from    the border?,8    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
79,GARAK,   Perhaps they've been sent to the    Romulan front.,8    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
80,WORF,   Then how many ships does the    Dominion have at Chin'toka?,8    INT. WARDROOM,WARDROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
81,SISKO ,   Five squadrons of Jem'Hadar    attack ships.,9    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE (OPTICAL),CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
82,SISKO,"   At the moment, that's the entire    Dominion ""fleet"" protecting the    Chin'toka System.",9    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE (OPTICAL),CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
83,MARTOK,   Only five squadrons... It    appears you've found the weak    spot we've been looking for.,9    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE (OPTICAL),CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
84,SISKO,   Now all we have to do is    convince the Romulans to join    us.,9    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE (OPTICAL),CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
85,MARTOK,        That won't be an easy task.    They're an arrogant and    untrustworthy people.,9    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE (OPTICAL),CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
86,ROSS,"   Without their help, we'd have    little chance of success.",9    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE (OPTICAL),CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
87,MARTOK,"   We will succeed. Mark my words.    By this time next year, the    three of us will drink bloodwine    in the halls of Cardassia's    Central Command.",9    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE (OPTICAL),CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
88,DAMAR,        You're worrying about nothing.,12   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
89,WEYOUN,"   Am I? It's a mistake to    underestimate our enemy, Damar.    You're spreading our forces too    thinly.",12   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
90,DAMAR,"   Until we can find a way to bring    reinforcements from the Gamma    Quadrant, we have to make due    with what we have. Besides, you   told me we needed more ships on    the Romulan front. So I sent    them.",12   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
91,WEYOUN,"   And in doing so, you left the    Chin'toka System vulnerable.",12   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
92,DAMAR,   Not as vulnerable as you think.,12   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
93,DAMAR ,"   You see, we don't need starships    to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore.",12   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
94,DAMAR,   These are our new unmanned    orbital weapon platforms. Their    hulls are protected by    regenerative forcefields and    their arsenals include a    thousand plasma torpedoes.,12   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
95,WEYOUN,   I like them.,12   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
96,DAMAR,   I thought you would. Which is    why I've already ordered their    deployment.,12   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
97,GLINN,"        Legate Damar, excuse the    interruption but we have a...    problem.",12   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
98,DAMAR,   What kind of problem?,12   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine

100,DUKAT,   Isn't anyone going to welcome me    home?,12   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
101,WEYOUN,"   Heroes get welcomed home, Dukat.    Not failures. Or have you    forgotten that under your    leadership the Dominion almost    lost this war?",12   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
102,DUKAT,"   As I recall, you were right by    my side, agreeing with every one    of my decisions.",12   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine

104,DUKAT,"   You disappoint me, Damar. I    thought you, of all people,    would be glad to see your old    mentor.        Besides, I don't hold you    responsible for Ziyal's death.    You may have fired the phaser,    but it was Benjamin Sisko who    forced your hand. And that's    why I'm here.",12   INT.

106,WEYOUN,"   We're in the middle of a life-   and-death struggle for control   of the entire Alpha Quadrant,   and all you care about is   quenching your petty thirst for   revenge.       You haven't changed a bit, have   you?",12   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
107,DUKAT,"   On the contrary, I'm a new man.   I no longer have a need for   conquest or power. I've moved   beyond all that... I exist in a   state of perfect clarity. A   clarity I intend to share with   the universe.",12   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
108,WEYOUN,"   You're right, Dukat. You have    changed. You've gone from being    a self-important egotist to a    self-deluded madman. I hardly    call that an improvement.

110,DUKAT,   Isn't that obvious?,12   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
111,DUKAT,   To give you what you desire    above all else. The Alpha    Quadrant.,12   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine

113,WEYOUN,   And how is this artifact going    to help us?,12   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
114,DUKAT,   Let's just say it will make it    possible for Dominion    reinforcements to come through    the wormhole and destroy Captain   Sisko and the Federation once    and for all.,12   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM,INT.,,1998-04-08,Deep Space Nine
