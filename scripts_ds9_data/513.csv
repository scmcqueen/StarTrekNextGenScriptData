57,DUKAT,       You might ask... should we fear    joining the Dominion? And I    answer you... Not in the least.    We should embrace the opportunity.

66,O'BRIEN,"   I don't know who it was, but they    did a pretty thorough job. The    emitters had the exact opposite    effect from what we'd intended.
