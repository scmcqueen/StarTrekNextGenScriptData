0,WEYOUN,   Commander Worf... I hope you'll    accept my deepest sympathies    regarding the approaching demise    of the Klingon Empire.,1    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
1,WORF,   The Klingon Empire will outlive    the Dominion by many centuries.,1    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
2,WEYOUN,"   Your loyalty to a hopeless cause    is admirable.    (turning his    attention to Ezri)   You must be Ezri Dax. My   predecessors -- Weyoun Four and   Five -- had a high regard for    your predecessor, Jadzia.",1    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
3,EZRI,"   I assure you, the feeling wasn't    mutual.",1    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
4,WEYOUN,"   How unfortunate. After all, you    and I have so much in common.    We're both merely individual    links in a long chain.",1    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
5,EZRI,   And that's where any similarity    ends...,1    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
6,WEYOUN,        I hoped we could have an amicable    relationship.    (to a Jem'Hadar     soldier),1    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
7,WEYOUN ,   Secure the prisoners below. And   make sure they share a cell.        They may wish to physically    comfort each other during the    long trip back to Cardassia.,1    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
8,WEYOUN,        I find inter-species mating    rituals fascinating to watch.    Don't you?,1    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
9,DAMAR,        Interesting device.,1    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
10,WEYOUN,"        I'm so sorry. Where are my    manners?        Allow me to introduce Legate    Damar, head of the Cardassian    Union.        Thot Gor.",1    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
11,DAMAR,        What did he say?,1    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
12,WEYOUN,   He says you need to get your    universal translator adjusted.,1    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
13,DAMAR,   I would've -- if I had known we   were meeting with the Breen.,1    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
14,FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER,   It is a distinct pleasure to    finally meet you.,1B   INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
15,FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER,"   Thank you. If our face-to-face    talks are as productive as our    subspace communications have    been, I'm sure we'll sign the    treaty documents within a few    days.",1B   INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
16,DAMAR,        I haven't even seen this treaty.,1B   INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
17,WEYOUN,        We'll discuss it later.,1B   INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
18,FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER,"        This is a great day. The    alliance between the Breen    Confederacy and the Dominion will    end the destructive war that has    torn this quadrant apart for so    long. With the Breen at our    side, the Federation will not be    able to stand against us.    They'll be erased from the face    of the galaxy...",1B   INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
19,DAMAR,   This is outrageous! Have you    read this treaty?,4    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
20,WEYOUN,   Parts of it.,4    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
21,DAMAR,"   There's a reference to    ""territorial concessions"" that    Cardassia will make to the Breen.    But it doesn't say what those    concessions are.",4    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
22,WEYOUN,"        Oh, you needn't worry about that.    They've all been itemized in a    secret protocol between the    Dominion and the Breen. All    you're required to do is sign the    document as the acknowledged    leader of the Cardassian Union.",4    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
23,DAMAR,   I want to see this protocol.,4    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
24,WEYOUN,"   It wouldn't be much of a secret   then, would it?",4    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
25,DAMAR,        You expect me to agree to    territorial concessions when I    don't even know what they are?,4    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
26,WEYOUN,"   Damar, you're missing the point.    We need the Breen to win this    war. When it's over, there will    be more than enough territories    available to compensate Cardassia    for the loss of a few minor    planets.",4    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
27,DAMAR,"   There are no ""minor"" planets in    the Cardassian Union --",4    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
28,WEYOUN,   You know what I think you should    do? Talk to Thot Gor. Express    your concerns. He's very   reasonable and quite personable    once you get to know him.,4    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
29,DAMAR,   I don't trust him or his people.    The Founders should never have    agreed to give away Cardassian    territory without my consent!,4    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
30,WEYOUN,"   I'm sorry, I think I    misunderstood you. It sounded as    if you were implying that   Cardassian territory did not    belong to the Founders. Surely    that's not what you meant.",4    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
31,DAMAR,   No. Of course not.,4    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
32,WEYOUN,   Good. I look forward to   receiving the signed documents   from you within the hour.,4    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
33,WEYOUN,   Is there something else?,4    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
34,DAMAR,   The Klingons have attacked Septimus    Three.,4    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
35,WEYOUN,   I'm aware of that.,4    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
36,DAMAR,   Are you also aware that they've    landed fifteen divisions? The    Cardassian troops will not    survive without reinforcements.,4    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
37,WEYOUN,   I assure you that the Septimus    Three situation will be dealt    with. We won't allow your brave    soldiers to perish in vain. You    have my word.,4    INT. JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,JEM'HADAR BRIDGE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
38,MARTOK,   Septimus Three will fall within    the week! The Cardassian Eleventh    Order is a reserve unit -- old men   and walking wounded. They don't    stand a chance.,6    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
39,SISKO,   I think you're right.,6    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
40,MARTOK,"        But enough about the war with the    Dominion. I want to hear about    the war at home.        You just married that freighter    captain, didn't you?",6    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
41,SISKO,   Yes...,6    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
42,MARTOK,"   Then war has broken out, whether    you know it or not. A long,    grueling, intoxicating war.        I remember the day my beloved    Sirella first moved into my home.    I had a pet targ. Had him since    I was a boy. A filthy, mangy    beast -- but in his bony breast    beat the heart of a warrior. Of    course, Sirella loathed him.       To make a long story short, while    supervising the unloading of her    bags, Sirella ""accidently"" left    the front door open.    ",6    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
43,MARTOK ,"   My faithful targ, ever-ready to   follow the call of the wild,   tottered outside on his frail   legs and disappeared into the   forest.       I never laid eyes on him again.",6    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
44,SISKO,   Lady Sirella draws first blood.,6    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
45,MARTOK,"   You see my point. Don't get me   wrong, I would not trade Sirella   for all the targs on Kronos...    And over the course of our   marriage I've won more than my   fair share of the battles between   us.       But in the end, I know she will   win the war.",6    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1999-01-26,Deep Space Nine
