3,DAX,   They're not answering.       Their life-support systems are    operating on reserve power.,2    INT. OPS (OPTICAL),OPS,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine

8,NATIMA,"   We were caught in a meteor swarm.     I'm a decent teacher, but I'm afraid    I'm not much of a shuttle pilot.       Do you think you'll be able to repair    our ship?",4    INT. CARGO BAY SEVEN,CARGO BAY SEVEN,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine
9,O'BRIEN,   I'll have to take a look.  Excuse    me.,4    INT. CARGO BAY SEVEN,CARGO BAY SEVEN,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine
10,NATIMA,   We'd like to be on our way as soon    as possible.  We know having    Cardassians on a Bajoran station may    cause trouble.  That's the last thing    we want.,4    INT. CARGO BAY SEVEN,CARGO BAY SEVEN,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine
11,SISKO,"   If anyone can fix your ship, it's    Mister O'Brien.  In the meantime,    you're welcome to stay here.  If you    stick to the Promenade, I'm sure    there won't be any trouble.",4    INT. CARGO BAY SEVEN,CARGO BAY SEVEN,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine

13,GARAK,   Of course I agree.  Yiri's brother    was a traitor to the Trelonian    government.,5    INT. QUARK'S - SECOND LEVEL,QUARK'S,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine
14,BASHIR,   But the evidence is all    circumstantial.,5    INT. QUARK'S - SECOND LEVEL,QUARK'S,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine
15,GARAK,"   My dear Doctor... it all comes down    to a question of loyalty.  Yiri had    to choose between protecting his    brother or protecting the state.  He    chose the state... as would I, every    time.",5    INT. QUARK'S - SECOND LEVEL,QUARK'S,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine

25,GARAK,   Or maybe I'm an outcast spy?,5    INT. QUARK'S - SECOND LEVEL,QUARK'S,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine

34,ODO,   I didn't expect you to admit it.     I'm simply serving notice:  You try    to sell it and I'll see to it that    you spend the next fifty years digging    trenches in a penal colony.,5    INT. QUARK'S (MAIN FLOOR),QUARK'S,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine

79,NATIMA,"       Please.  I haven't heard a Rule of    Acquisition in seven years.  And I    don't want to hear one now.       You never apologized, Quark.  You    never admitted you were wrong.  I    think that hurt more than anything.",10   INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine

92,SISKO,   How are your repairs coming?,16   INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine
93,O'BRIEN,   The damage is more extensive than I    thought.       They were lucky to survive the attack.,16   INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine
94,SISKO,   The attack?,16   INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine
95,O'BRIEN,   They weren't in any meteor swarm.     Their ship was hit by Cardassian    disrupters.,16   INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine
96,KIRA,   That doesn't make sense.  Why would    Cardassians fire on other Cardassians?,16   INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine

103,KIRA,   Then why didn't you?,16   INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine
104,NATIMA,   Because Cardassians don't involve    outsiders in their internal politics.     Especially Bajorans.,16   INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine
105,SISKO,   Being shot at by your own people    goes a little beyond politics.,16   INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine
106,NATIMA,"       We take our politics very seriously.       Commander, if I don't get my students    to safety they're going to be killed.     And if they die, the future of    Cardassia may die with them.",16   INT. OPS,OPS,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine

113,SISKO,       Which makes you fugitives.,17   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine
114,HOGUE,   The military's afraid to let us speak    our minds.,17   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine
115,NATIMA,"   We only want a better future for all    Cardassians.  A future based on peace    and non-violence.

117,NATIMA,   Ours is no exception.,17   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine
118,REKELEN,   They've already tried to kill us    once... they're sure to try again.,17   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine
119,NATIMA,       Which is why I have to get them off    this station... as soon as possible.,17   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine

124,NATIMA,   I'm certain of it.,17   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine
125,SISKO,   Then... we may have a problem.  Mister    Garak is a bit of a mystery to us.     One of my officers is convinced he    works for Cardassian Intelligence.     For all I know he could be right.,17   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine

153,GARAK,"   You'd be surprised how detrimental a    poor choice of fashion can be.  Take    this dress.

158,GARAK ,   And I know there's nothing worse    than following the wrong trend.  Now    you're a smart fellow.    (glances at Quark's     clothing)   With your own inimitable style.     Perhaps you should mention that to    your lady friend.  I'd hate to see    her become... a victim of fashion.,18   INT. GARAK'S SHOP,GARAK'S SHOP,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine
159,QUARK,   Would you like to explain that?,18   INT. GARAK'S SHOP,GARAK'S SHOP,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine
160,GARAK,   She's chosen to associate herself    with some rather flamboyant    companions.  It would be a tragedy    if she got in the way when her    friends... went out of style.,18   INT. GARAK'S SHOP,GARAK'S SHOP,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine

243,GARAK,"       Really, Commander, that's another    discussion, entirely.  All you need    to know right now is that the return    of Hogue and Rekelen is in the best    interests of the Cardassian Empire.",24   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE,COMMANDER'S OFFICE,INT.,,1994-01-13,Deep Space Nine
