5,BASHIR,"   Turning off the holosuite safety    protocols during a battle    simulation is a dubious idea    at best. For a man with only one eye    it's idiotic. Now, if you'd like    to consider an ocular    replacement...",1    INT. INFIRMARY,INFIRMARY,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine

30,MARTOK,   Doctor Bashir has made the    necessary repairs -- and I told    him it was a holosuite accident.    He would not understand the need    to draw blood in a warrior's    training exercise.,3    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE,DEFIANT,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine

35,WORF,   Can you discuss your mission?,3    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE,DEFIANT,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine
36,MARTOK,"   Three days ago, the battle cruiser    B'Moth began a patrol near the    Cardassian border. They have not    been heard from since and have    been reported as missing.",3    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE,DEFIANT,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine
37,WORF,   It is possible she was destroyed    by the Dominion. The Jem'Hadar    attacked a Federation starship    near the border less than a week    ago.,3    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE,DEFIANT,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine
38,MARTOK,"   That is our assumption as well,    but we must be certain. So I am    being given command of a Bird of    Prey -- the Rotarran -- to conduct    a search for the B'Moth.         This will be the first time I have    led troops in the field since    my... confinement by the    Dominion.",3    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE,DEFIANT,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine

40,MARTOK,"   I tell you, Worf -- without shame --    that there were days in that    prison camp... when the thought    that I would never again set foot    on a Klingon vessel... made me    weep like an old woman.",3    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE,DEFIANT,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine

42,MARTOK,"   An adventure that we could share,   my friend. I need someone who I    can trust at my side. Someone    whose loyalty I can count on.        Worf, son of Mogh... I ask you to   join me on this mission as my    friend... and as my first    officer.",3    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE,DEFIANT,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine
43,SISKO,"   I told the General I'm inclined to    grant his request for your    services, commander. I can    certainly understand why he'd want    you along -- you're a fine    officer. But I'm not sure why you    want to go on this mission.",5    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine
44,WORF,   It is... a great honor to be asked    to serve under General Martok.         And... he saved my life in the    Dominion prison camp.,5    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine

46,WORF,   It was a personal matter -- not    something that belongs in an    official report.,5    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine
47,WORF,"        You... know that I was forced to   fight the Jem'Hadar guards in the    camp...        Each day they would call me to the    ring and each day I would fight.    But then, there came a day when    I... wavered.",5    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine
48,SISKO,   You mean you didn't want to go    back into the ring?,5    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine
49,WORF,"   No. I mean that I considered    letting them kill me. It seemed    like the only way out.        Just before I went into the ring,    Martok turned to wish me    success... and then he saw what    I was planning -- saw it in my    eyes. It was a moment of    Tova'dok.",5    INT.

50,SISKO,   Of what?,5    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine
51,WORF,"   There is no human word for it. It    is a moment of... clarity between    two warriors on the field of    battle. Much is said without the    need for words. In that moment,    Martok knew what was in my mind.        Once I realized that he saw my    intention to give up, I could no    longer go through with it. I went    back into the ring... and fought    once more.",5    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine
52,WORF,   Perhaps it is something that a    human cannot understand...,5    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine
53,SISKO,   As of this moment you will be    relieved of all Starfleet    obligations and will be placed on    detached service to the Imperial    Klingon Defense Forces.,5    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,CAPTAIN'S OFFICE,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine

61,KIRA,"   It has to be a Starfleet officer    with a level four security    clearance. That means either you    or Dax, and I need Dax to take    over as Fleet Liaison Officer.",7    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine
62,O'BRIEN,   It beats retuning phaser rifles.,7    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine

64,DAX,"   Julian, have you ever been on a    Klingon ship? If you think the    Defiant is cramped and    uncomfortable, try spending a week    on a bird of prey. Worf isn't    exactly taking a luxury cruise.",7    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine
65,O'BRIEN,"   I've heard that serving on a    Klingon ship is like being with a    gang of ancient sea pirates. You    advance in rank by killing the    people above you, so everywhere    you turn you're surrounded by    potential assassins.",7    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine
66,KIRA,   That's crazy. How can a ship    function like that?,7    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine
67,DAX,   It's not quite that chaotic. The    social and military hierarchy on    a Klingon vessel is very strictly    enforced. A subordinate can only    challenge his direct superior and    only under certain conditions.,7    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine
68,BASHIR,"   What sort of ""conditions?""",7    INT. QUARK'S,QUARK'S,INT.,,1997-02-13,Deep Space Nine
