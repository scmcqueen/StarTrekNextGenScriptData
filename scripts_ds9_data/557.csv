1,BASHIR,"   All right. Try this: in    Eighteen thirty-six Crockett is    forty-nine -- quite old by the    standards of the time. His days    as an Indian fighter are well    behind him. He's just an ex-   Congressman... all reputation.    He's not going to be the man who    fights to his last breath. When    it's clearly hopeless, when the    ammunition is gone and Mexican    soldiers are swarming over the    Alamo's battlements, Davy    Crockett would surrender.    It's logical.",2    INT.
