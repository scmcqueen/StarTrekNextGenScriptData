22,O'BRIEN,   Full dress uniforms... fine table    linens... and a different fork for    every course... thanks but no thanks.     That's why I stayed an enlisted man.     No one expects us to show up for    formal dinners.,2    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine

30,O'BRIEN,       Nothing serious.  Just a power    fluctuation in the annular confinement    beam.       Hold on.  That's impossible.,6    INT. DEFIANT - TRANSPORTER ROOM,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine

64,DAX,   Something like that.       Thanks for the help.,12   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - DAY #1,SAN FRANCISCO STREET,EXT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine

66,O'BRIEN,"   Check the Heisenberg compensators.     I'll run a level-one diagnostic of    the pattern buffer, see if there's    any kind of field imbalance.",13   INT. DEFIANT - TRANSPORTER ROOM,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
67,KIRA,   Chief.,13   INT. DEFIANT - TRANSPORTER ROOM,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
68,O'BRIEN,       Any news from Starfleet?,13   INT. DEFIANT - TRANSPORTER ROOM,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
69,KIRA,"   Nothing good.  As far as they can    tell, Commander Sisko and the others    never materialized in San Francisco.     According to their sensors, our    transporter signal disintegrated    immediately after we began the beam    out sequence.",13   INT. DEFIANT - TRANSPORTER ROOM,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
70,O'BRIEN,       That doesn't agree with our records.     The system log shows that the    transport was completed successfully.     They definitely materialized    somewhere.,13   INT. DEFIANT - TRANSPORTER ROOM,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
71,KIRA,"   That's good news, anyway.  The    question is... where?",13   INT. DEFIANT - TRANSPORTER ROOM,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
72,O'BRIEN,"   I wish I knew.  Whatever the answer    is, it's not in the log.  The only    thing unusual it recorded was the    variance in the annular confinement    beam...",13   INT. DEFIANT - TRANSPORTER ROOM,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
73,KIRA,   But you corrected for that..,13   INT. DEFIANT - TRANSPORTER ROOM,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
74,O'BRIEN,       It was a simple adjustment.  The    beam was just reacting to the    accumulation of chroniton particles    in the ship's hull.,13   INT. DEFIANT - TRANSPORTER ROOM,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
75,KIRA,   Chroniton particles?,13   INT. DEFIANT - TRANSPORTER ROOM,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
76,O'BRIEN,       They're emitted by the cloaking    device.  Sometimes they become lodged    in the ship's ablative armor matrix.,13   INT. DEFIANT - TRANSPORTER ROOM,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
77,KIRA,   But we've used the transporter many    times since the cloaking device was    installed.  There's never been a    problem before.,13   INT. DEFIANT - TRANSPORTER ROOM,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
78,O'BRIEN,   And I don't know why it would be a    problem now.,13   INT. DEFIANT - TRANSPORTER ROOM,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
79,O'BRIEN,   Wait a minute.       It looks like there was a surge of    temporal energy a few seconds before    the initiation of the transporter    sequence.,13   INT. DEFIANT - TRANSPORTER ROOM,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
80,KIRA,       Tell me that's a clue.,13   INT. DEFIANT - TRANSPORTER ROOM,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
81,O'BRIEN,   It's a clue all right.  I'm just not    sure what it means yet.,13   INT. DEFIANT - TRANSPORTER ROOM,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
82,BASHIR,       How do you feel?,14   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - SANCTUARY DISTRICT GATE -,SAN FRANCISCO,EXT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
83,SISKO,   Better.,14   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - SANCTUARY DISTRICT GATE -,SAN FRANCISCO,EXT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
84,BASHIR,"   Me too.  Probably transporter shock.     Disorienting, but it wears off    quickly.       At least I know one thing... we're    definitely in San Francisco.  I caught    a glimpse of the Golden Gate Bridge    a few blocks back.",14   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - SANCTUARY DISTRICT GATE -,SAN FRANCISCO,EXT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
85,SISKO,       I saw it too.,14   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - SANCTUARY DISTRICT GATE -,SAN FRANCISCO,EXT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
86,BASHIR,   Any idea what happened to our    combadges?,14   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - SANCTUARY DISTRICT GATE -,SAN FRANCISCO,EXT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
87,SISKO,   They must've been stolen when we    were unconscious.,14   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - SANCTUARY DISTRICT GATE -,SAN FRANCISCO,EXT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
88,SISKO,"   This isn't the Earth we're used to,    Doctor.  That's still at least a    century away.       I wish I knew what happened to Dax.",14   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - SANCTUARY DISTRICT GATE -,SAN FRANCISCO,EXT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
89,BASHIR,   She was in the transporter beam with    us.  Whatever affected us must've    affected her too.,14   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - SANCTUARY DISTRICT GATE -,SAN FRANCISCO,EXT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
90,SISKO,   That means she's probably somewhere    nearby.,14   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - SANCTUARY DISTRICT GATE -,SAN FRANCISCO,EXT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
91,SISKO,"       As soon as we get a chance, we've    got to find her.",14   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - SANCTUARY DISTRICT GATE -,SAN FRANCISCO,EXT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
92,BASHIR,   And then what?,14   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - SANCTUARY DISTRICT GATE -,SAN FRANCISCO,EXT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
93,SISKO,   And then... we find a way home.,14   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - SANCTUARY DISTRICT GATE -,SAN FRANCISCO,EXT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine

193,LEE,   One more thing... a little advice.     Stay away from District Security.     They've had their budget cut again.     They're overworked and underpaid...

336,SISKO,   That was Gabriel Bell.,49   EXT. SANCTUARY ALLEY - NIGHT #2,SANCTUARY ALLEY,EXT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine

338,O'BRIEN,"   Too late, Major.  It looks like    Starfleet's changed our minds for    us.       I just got a message from Admiral    Wright of Starfleet Command.     Headquarters thinks our plan's too    risky.  They're afraid that while    we're searching for Sisko and the    others, we might contaminate the    timeline.",50   INT.

339,KIRA,   Get me Admiral Wright.,50   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
340,O'BRIEN,       I had a feeling you'd say that.,50   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
341,O'BRIEN,   That's odd.,50   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
342,KIRA,   What is it?,50   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
343,O'BRIEN,   I'm not getting any response from    Starfleet.,50   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
344,ODO,   Is there something wrong with our    communications array?  I was just    speaking to Starfleet Security when    my com-line went dead.,50   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
345,O'BRIEN,       There's nothing wrong on our end.     Everything checks out fine.,50   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
346,KIRA,   It could be interference on the com    channels.  Try a wide band subspace    signal.,50   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
347,O'BRIEN,   Still nothing.       Maybe if I direct it toward one of    the Federation communications    satellites in Earth orbit...,50   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine

355,KIRA,   That's impossible.,50   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
356,ODO,   Do you think Sisko and the others    might've somehow altered the timeline?,50   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
357,O'BRIEN,   They must've.,50   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
358,KIRA,   Then why weren't we affected?,50   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine
359,O'BRIEN,"   I'm not sure...       Maybe... maybe when it exploded, the    singularity that polarized the    chroniton particles created some    kind of subspace bubble around the    ship... isolated it from the changes    in the timeline.  I'd have to run    tests to be sure.       But one thing's for certain, right    now this ship is all that's left of    Starfleet.",50   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE,DEFIANT,INT.,,1994-10-18,Deep Space Nine

372,WEBB,"   Good.       One more thing.  Tell people when    they come to the rally to bring their    families, their kids, and try to    look their best.  After all, we're    not derelicts.
