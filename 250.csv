19,DATA,"   Yes, sir. It appears that we will   be able to transport to the   surface sooner than we   anticipated.","""Second Chances"""
20,RIKER,   Is the planet's distortion field   de-phasing sooner than you   predicted?,"""Second Chances"""
21,DATA,"   No, sir. But using the Potemkin's   transport logs from the original   evacuation, Commander La Forge and   I were able to modify the   Transporters.","""Second Chances"""
22,RIKER,       So we can beam through higher   distortion levels.,"""Second Chances"""
23,DATA,       The Transporters are now   considerably more efficient than   those used on the Potemkin eight   years ago.,"""Second Chances"""
24,RIKER,   Glad to hear it. I almost didn't   make it off the surface that day.       When can we get started?,"""Second Chances"""
25,DATA,   Ninety-seven minutes.,"""Second Chances"""

27,DATA,"   Twenty-six minutes. After that,   the distortion field will re-phase.","""Second Chances"""
28,RIKER,   That doesn't give us much time to   retrieve the database.,"""Second Chances"""
29,DATA,   The planet's proximity to its sun   will create two additional   transport windows in the next   three days.,"""Second Chances"""
30,RIKER,   Let's hope that's enough.,"""Second Chances"""
31,DATA,"   It will have to be. The next   transport window will not occur   for another eight years, when the   planet's orbit brings it close   enough to the sun to de-phase the   distortion field.","""Second Chances"""

49,RIKER,   What ship were you on?,"""Second Chances"""
50,LT. RIKER,   The Potemkin.,"""Second Chances"""
51,DATA,   Why did you not return to the   Potemkin with the others?,"""Second Chances"""
52,LT. RIKER,"   I was the last one out. The   distortion field must have   interfered with the transport;   they lost their signal lock on me.   When I tried to contact the ship,   I couldn't get through the   interference.","""Second Chances"""
53,LT. RIKER,   Check with Starfleet; I'm sure   they recorded me lost that day.,"""Second Chances"""
54,RIKER,   That's not what happened. I was   the last one out... but I made it   back to the Potemkin.,"""Second Chances"""
55,LT. RIKER,   You don't believe me.,"""Second Chances"""
56,RIKER,   It's not that we don't believe   you; it's just hard to see how   both our stories could be true.       Would you be willing to let our   Doctor check you out?,"""Second Chances"""
57,LT. RIKER,   Of course.,"""Second Chances"""
58,RIKER,"   Lieutenant Worf, take him to   Sickbay. Notify the Captain as   soon as you're aboard.","""Second Chances"""
59,WORF,       Worf to Enterprise. Two to beam   up.,"""Second Chances"""
60,RIKER,   Let's get to work.,"""Second Chances"""
61,BEVERLY,   Looks like you fractured your arm   a few years ago.,"""Second Chances"""
62,LT. RIKER,   I was underneath the station   making repairs when an earthquake   hit -- I got caught in a   rockslide. I had to set it   myself.,"""Second Chances"""
63,PICARD,   Captain Jean-Luc Picard.,"""Second Chances"""
64,LT. RIKER,"   Lieutenant Wil Riker, sir.","""Second Chances"""
65,PICARD,"   If you are Wil Riker, if there are   two of you... then something   extraordinary has occurred. I   hope you understand our need to   verify your claim.","""Second Chances"""

67,BEVERLY,"   Genetically, he's   indistinguishable from Commander   Riker.","""Second Chances"""

69,BEVERLY,"   I don't think so, there's no   genetic drift.","""Second Chances"""
70,PICARD,   But that isn't conclusive.,"""Second Chances"""
71,BEVERLY,"   That's why I compared their brain   scans. Brain organization   patterns are as unique as...   fingerprints. Except for some   minor differences, theirs are   identical.","""Second Chances"""
72,PICARD,   Can't brain patterns be cloned?,"""Second Chances"""
73,BEVERLY,"   No. They're determined by   experience, mostly in early   childhood.","""Second Chances"""

76,PICARD,       Lieutenant -- my Chief Engineer is   checking over the transport logs   from the Potemkin. They may shed   some light on what happened.,"""Second Chances"""
77,LT. RIKER,"   Yes, sir.","""Second Chances"""
78,PICARD,"   Don't worry, we'll get to the   bottom of this.","""Second Chances"""
79,PICARD,   In the meantime you'll be taken to   quarters. Make yourself   comfortable.,"""Second Chances"""
80,LT. RIKER,"   I will, sir. The replicators on   the station stopped working a long   time ago. It's been a while since   I had a decent meal.","""Second Chances"""
81,LT. RIKER,   Doctor...,"""Second Chances"""
82,GEORDI,       ... apparently there was a massive   energy surge in the distortion   field around the planet just at   the moment you tried to beam out.   The Transporter Chief tried to   compensate by initiating a second   containment beam.,"""Second Chances"""
83,DATA,   An interesting approach. He must   have been planning to reintegrate   the two patterns in the transport   buffer.,"""Second Chances"""
84,GEORDI,   Turns out he didn't have to.   Commander Riker's pattern   maintained its integrity with just   the one containment beam -- he   made it back to the ship just   fine.,"""Second Chances"""
85,BEVERLY,   What happened to the second beam?,"""Second Chances"""
86,GEORDI,"   The Transporter Chief shut it   down, but somehow... it was   reflected back to the surface.","""Second Chances"""
87,PICARD,   And another Wil Riker materialized   there.,"""Second Chances"""
88,RIKER,   How could the second pattern have   maintained its integrity?,"""Second Chances"""
89,GEORDI,   The containment beam must have had   the exact same phase differential   as the distortion field.,"""Second Chances"""
90,RIKER,   Which one of us is... real?,"""Second Chances"""
91,GEORDI,   Both. You were both re-materialized   from a complete   pattern.,"""Second Chances"""
92,BEVERLY,"       Up to that moment, you were the   same person.","""Second Chances"""
93,PICARD,"   But over the last eight years, you   and...","""Second Chances"""
94,PICARD,       -- Lieutenant Riker have lived   very different lives. You're   different people now.,"""Second Chances"""
95,PICARD,"   For us, it's a little like meeting   a close friend's twin. You can't   help feeling that you know them...   but of course you don't.","""Second Chances"""
96,PICARD,"   No matter how strange it may seem   to us... there are now two Wil   Rikers aboard this vessel.   Getting used to the idea may take   a while... especially for you,   Wil.","""Second Chances"""
97,RIKER,"   I'll be all right, sir.","""Second Chances"""
98,PICARD,   Lieutenant Riker will be here for   a few days at least. We should do   everything we can to make him feel   comfortable and welcome.,"""Second Chances"""
99,RIKER,   That still leaves us with the   problem of how to retrieve the   database. The station's computer   is only partially operational.,"""Second Chances"""
100,DATA,   Many of its components have been   removed. Apparently Lieutenant   Riker used them to keep the   station's radiation shield   operational.,"""Second Chances"""
101,PICARD,"   Can we repair it, at least enough   to access the database?","""Second Chances"""
102,RIKER,"   Without knowing what he did, it'll   be tough.","""Second Chances"""
103,BEVERLY,   Maybe he could help?,"""Second Chances"""
104,PICARD,   He was alone down there a long   time. I'm hesitant to send him   back until he's been evaluated.,"""Second Chances"""

116,TROI,   Wil -- why don't we sit down?,"""Second Chances"""
117,TROI,   Do you remember the last time we   saw each other?,"""Second Chances"""
118,LT. RIKER,"   Like yesterday. We spent the day   at the Janaran falls, on Betazed.","""Second Chances"""
119,TROI,   It was the day before you started   your tour on the Potemkin.,"""Second Chances"""
120,LT. RIKER,"       We were going to meet six weeks   later, on Risa.","""Second Chances"""
121,TROI,   We never did.,"""Second Chances"""
122,LT. RIKER,       I know.,"""Second Chances"""
123,TROI,   What I mean is... Commander Riker   and I never did.,"""Second Chances"""
124,TROI,   You see... he earned a promotion   very quickly.,"""Second Chances"""
125,LT. RIKER,   I know.       For exceptional valor during the   evacuation of the research station   on Nervala Four.       I looked over his service record.,"""Second Chances"""
126,TROI,   He chose to make his career a   priority. There wasn't time for   much of anything else.,"""Second Chances"""
127,TROI,   We kept in touch... but we didn't   see each other again until we were   both posted to the Enterprise two   years later.,"""Second Chances"""
128,TROI,"   By then, our feelings for each   other had changed. We've served   together for six years now...   things never went back to the way   they used to be.","""Second Chances"""
129,LT. RIKER,   I had a lot of time on my hands   down there. There were days I   felt so alone I thought I might   lose my mind.,"""Second Chances"""
130,LT. RIKER,"       Do you know what got me through?       Thinking that if I could hang on,   one more day, maybe I'd be   rescued... and I'd see you again.","""Second Chances"""
131,LT. RIKER,   Well... I guess things don't   always turn out quite the way you   expect them to.,"""Second Chances"""
132,TROI,"   I know this isn't what you were   hoping for, but that doesn't mean   you can't make a future for   yourself.","""Second Chances"""
133,LT. RIKER,"   For now, I think I'll just take   things one day at a time.","""Second Chances"""
134,TROI,   Captain Picard wanted me to find   out if you'd be willing to help us   retrieve the station's database.,"""Second Chances"""
135,LT. RIKER,   I reconfigured that computer   system so many times they probably   can't make heads or tails of it.   I'd be happy to help.,"""Second Chances"""
136,TROI,   Do you feel up to it?,"""Second Chances"""
137,LT. RIKER,   Absolutely.,"""Second Chances"""
138,TROI,   I'll tell the Captain.,"""Second Chances"""
139,TROI,   Well... I have to go.,"""Second Chances"""
140,LT. RIKER,   Deanna... I know it's been a long   time since we were together; I   know your feelings have changed.   But...,"""Second Chances"""
141,LT. RIKER,   Mine haven't. I can't just give   up and accept that it's over... I   want to be with you again.,"""Second Chances"""
142,TROI,"       Good night, Wil...","""Second Chances"""
143,PALMER,       Phase distortion is dropping --   the second transport window will   open in forty-two seconds.,"""Second Chances"""
144,RIKER,   How long will we have?,"""Second Chances"""
145,PALMER,"   Thirty-six minutes, sir.","""Second Chances"""
146,WORF,   We are losing time. Lieutenant   Riker should be here.,"""Second Chances"""
147,RIKER,"   Computer, where is Lieutenant --","""Second Chances"""
148,RIKER,   Cancel inquiry.,"""Second Chances"""
149,WORF,   You were supposed to report here   at eight hundred hours.,"""Second Chances"""
150,LT. RIKER,"   I'm sorry, I was --","""Second Chances"""
151,RIKER,       I guess it's been a while since   you had to punch a clock.,"""Second Chances"""
152,RIKER,       Let's go.,"""Second Chances"""
153,RIKER,   Energize.,"""Second Chances"""
154,LT. RIKER,   I shut down most of the consoles   to save power. I re-routed just   about everything through here.,"""Second Chances"""
155,RIKER,"   Check out the primary EPS   coupling, see if you can get some   power to the rest of these   consoles.","""Second Chances"""
156,LT. RIKER,       I shunted the database to the main   core underneath the station.,"""Second Chances"""
157,RIKER,   Can we access it from here?,"""Second Chances"""
158,LT. RIKER,"   There's been a lot of seismic   activity over the years; if the   servo-links were damaged, we may   not be able to.","""Second Chances"""
159,LT. RIKER,   I'll try to tap into the command   pathways. See if you can disable   the file server.,"""Second Chances"""
160,RIKER,   I was thinking... we should   probably let Dad know what's   happened.,"""Second Chances"""
161,LT. RIKER,       I'm sure he'll be thrilled to hear   there are two of us now.,"""Second Chances"""
162,RIKER,   I don't know. He and I patched up   a few things.,"""Second Chances"""
163,LT. RIKER,   I've gotten by without talking to   him for a long time. I'm not   about to start now.,"""Second Chances"""
164,LT. RIKER,   What made you contact him?,"""Second Chances"""
165,RIKER,   I didn't. He came to the   Enterprise to brief me when I was   offered the Aries.,"""Second Chances"""
166,LT. RIKER,   What did he say when you turned   down the chance to command your   own ship?,"""Second Chances"""
167,RIKER,   He couldn't understand why I did   it.,"""Second Chances"""
168,LT. RIKER,   For once he and I agree on   something.,"""Second Chances"""
169,WORF,   The primary EPS coupling is fused.   It will have to be replaced.,"""Second Chances"""
170,LT. RIKER,       I've accessed the command   pathways.,"""Second Chances"""
171,RIKER,   Let's see if that does the trick.,"""Second Chances"""
172,LT. RIKER,   It's not working. The servo-link   must be damaged. We're going to   have to go under the station and   access the core directly.,"""Second Chances"""
173,DATA,   We have less than three minutes   left.,"""Second Chances"""
174,LT. RIKER,"   Leave me here. If I start now,   I'll be finished by the time the   third window opens.","""Second Chances"""
175,RIKER,   It's too dangerous. Our scans   show the caverns are unstable.,"""Second Chances"""
176,LT. RIKER,   I've been down there dozens of   times; I know my way around.,"""Second Chances"""
177,RIKER,   We'll come back during the third   window with a new EPS coupling and   try to access the core from   another console up here.,"""Second Chances"""

193,TROI,       You made this?,"""Second Chances"""

208,LT. RIKER,   Thanks.,"""Second Chances"""
209,LT. RIKER,"   I can't tell you how many times I   thought about you... about us.   The first few weeks after the   evacuation, I was sure they'd find   a way to get through the   distortion field and come back for   me.       I even thought we'd meet on Risa   like we planned.       But the days kept going by and   nobody came. Then I realized why.   They thought I'd been killed in   the beam out. As far as anyone   knew, there was no one to come   back for.       I figured they probably held a   memorial service for me.   Somehow... it made me feel   better.","""Second Chances"""

I   thought that if I could let you   know I was still alive... maybe   you'd wait for me.       I know it's crazy, but there were   a few times that... that I   could've sworn --","""Second Chances"""
214,LT. RIKER,   What am I talking about?,"""Second Chances"""
215,TROI,"   The other day, when I told you how   Commander Riker and I didn't meet   on Risa... what I didn't say was   how disappointed I was.","""Second Chances"""
216,LT. RIKER,   You didn't have to. I knew.,"""Second Chances"""
217,TROI,"   I started hearing from him less   and less... I knew his career was   taking him away from me, but I   didn't want to believe it was   over. I spent a lot of time   thinking about him, wondering   where he was, what he was doing.","""Second Chances"""

221,PICARD,"   Yes, Number One. Come in.","""Second Chances"""
222,PICARD,   Lieutenant Riker came to see me   about the away mission.,"""Second Chances"""
223,PICARD,   He believes the only way to   retrieve the database is by   directly accessing the main core   underneath the station.,"""Second Chances"""

225,PICARD,   He said he'd been down there quite   recently; he seems confident it   can be done safely.,"""Second Chances"""
226,RIKER,   There's a good chance we can   retrieve the database from one of   the consoles inside the station.,"""Second Chances"""
227,PICARD,"   But if that doesn't work, it'll be   eight years before we get another   chance.","""Second Chances"""
228,RIKER,"   Lieutenant Riker's plan is more   dangerous, but I'll admit, it has   a better chance of succeeding.","""Second Chances"""
229,PICARD,"   Given the importance of this data,   I think it's worth the risk.","""Second Chances"""
