236,DATA,"   I then drew an entire bird. A   flock of birds flying in   formation. An individual feather.       If the image of a bird is related   to my vision, I do not understand   how.       I am left with more of a mystery   than ever.","""Birthright"""

240,GEORDI,       Your neural net was almost fused   by that plasma shock. I don't   think it's such a good idea to try   it again...,"""Birthright"""

269,BASHIR,   I'm curious... now that those   circuits are active... what do you   intend to do with them?,"""Birthright"""
