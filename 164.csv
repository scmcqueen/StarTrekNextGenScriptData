4,GEORDI,   Something happened at that   cybernetics conference. Since   he's come back he's spent every   off duty minute in that lab.,"""The Offspring"""
5,TROI,   It is very unlike Data to be   secretive.,"""The Offspring"""

27,DATA,"   Exactly, Wesley. I realized for   the very first time it was possible   to continue Doctor Soong's work.   My initial transfers have produced   very encouraging results... so I   brought Lal's brain back with me   to continue.","""The Offspring"""

45,TROI,"   Why should biology or technology   determine whether it is a child?   I see a man who has created an   offspring... a new life out of   his own being. That suggests a   child to me. If Data wishes to   call Lal his child, who are we to   argue?","""The Offspring"""
46,PICARD,"       If he must, fine. But I don't   understand how he can call a five   foot android, with heuristic   learning systems and the strength   of a ten men a ""child"".","""The Offspring"""

49,DATA,"   I am sorry I did not anticipate   your objections, Captain. Do you   wish me to deactivate Lal?","""The Offspring"""
50,PICARD,"   It is a life, Data. It cannot   be activated or de-activated   simply. It is a stupendous   undertaking. Have you any idea   what will happen when Starfleet   learns of this?","""The Offspring"""

53,DATA,   I can assure you Lal's programming   includes psychological inhibitor   safeguards to prevent any threat   to the Enterprise.,"""The Offspring"""
54,PICARD,   And in the event of a malfunction?,"""The Offspring"""
55,DATA,"   A malfunction is of course a   possibility, Captain. But Lal's   program is equipped like mine --   it will shut down before   deleterious behavior can begin.","""The Offspring"""
56,PICARD,"   You've taken on quite a   responsibility, Mister Data...","""The Offspring"""
57,DATA,"       To prepare, I have scanned all   the available literature on   parenting. There seems to be much   confusion on the issue.

58,PICARD,       Data...,"""The Offspring"""
59,DATA,   And what the Klingons do to their   children...,"""The Offspring"""
60,PICARD,       I'm not talking about parenting.       I'm talking about the   extraordinary consequences of   creating new life.,"""The Offspring"""
61,DATA,"       Does that not describe becoming   a parent, sir?","""The Offspring"""
62,PICARD,"   You are seeking to achieve what   no one, other than your own   creator, has been able to achieve   -- to make another sentient,   functional android. To make   another Data.","""The Offspring"""
63,DATA,"   That is why I must attempt this,   Captain. I have observed that   in most species, there is a primal   instinct to perpetuate themselves.   And while I have not been   programmed with instinctive   behavior patterns, I do understand   that I have been, until now, the   last of my kind. If I were damaged   or destroyed, I would be lost   forever. But if I am successful   with the creation of Lal, my   continuance is assured. I believe   I understand the consequences.

73,LAL,       I choose... your sex... and   appearance.,"""The Offspring"""

112,DATA ,   Reflexes still need to develop.   The integration of hand/eye   coordination seems to be   proceeding at a slower   developmental rate.,"""The Offspring"""
113,DATA ,   Visual comprehension is especially   difficult for Lal. Translating   her vast data banks into   recognizable applications may   improve with additional transfers.,"""The Offspring"""
114,DATA ,   She is also learning to supplement   innate android behavior with human   responses.,"""The Offspring"""

121,DATA,"       Theoretically, the duplicate   brains should be able to store   and process the same   information... but until all the   transfers are complete, we will   not know for certain.","""The Offspring"""
122,WESLEY,   What does Lal do while you're on   duty?,"""The Offspring"""

137,DATA,   Because you are my child.,"""The Offspring"""
138,LAL,   Where did I come from?,"""The Offspring"""
139,DATA,"   Your questions suggest we have   made a successful transfer of the   heuristic associative pathways.   You will now begin to process   information on logic, aesthetics,   metaphysics, and epistemology.   You are truly becoming sentient,   Lal.","""The Offspring"""
140,LAL,   How?,"""The Offspring"""
141,DATA,   By developing the awareness to   examine and question your   perceptions.,"""The Offspring"""

146,PICARD,   This starship's mission is to   seek out new life and that is what   Commander Data is doing. Under my   direction.,"""The Offspring"""
147,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,   We only want what's best for the   new android.,"""The Offspring"""
148,PICARD,   As do I.       I would be willing to consider   releasing Lal and Data to join   you... so he may continue his work   with her.,"""The Offspring"""
149,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,"   I anticipated this suggestion.   Frankly, as extraordinary as he   is, Data's an imperfect role   model. In many ways, he's still   developing.","""The Offspring"""
150,PICARD,"       Aren't we all, Admiral...","""The Offspring"""
151,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,   His presence would undoubtedly   retard the the new android's   progress.,"""The Offspring"""

153,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,   His child.,"""The Offspring"""

157,DATA,   A perfect score.,"""The Offspring"""
158,BALLARD,   Yes. Which is why we started her   with the older children. But Lal   couldn't understand the nuances   of how they related to each other.,"""The Offspring"""
159,DATA,   I see.,"""The Offspring"""
160,BALLARD,   We decided the best thing to do   would be to put her with younger   children.,"""The Offspring"""
161,DATA,   That would seem to be reasonable.,"""The Offspring"""
162,BALLARD,   It isn't working out that way.,"""The Offspring"""
163,BALLARD,   The children are afraid of her.,"""The Offspring"""
164,LAL,"   Father, what is the significance   of laughter?","""The Offspring"""
165,DATA,   It is a human physiological   response to humor.,"""The Offspring"""
166,LAL,   Then judging from their laughter   the children at school found my   remarks humorous.       So without understanding humor   I have somehow mastered it.,"""The Offspring"""

171,LAL,   Explain.,"""The Offspring"""
172,DATA,   One is meant kindly... the other   is not.,"""The Offspring"""
173,LAL,   Why did they wish to be unkind?,"""The Offspring"""
174,DATA,   Because you are different. And   sometimes differences scare   people. I have learned that some   of them use humor to hide their   fears.,"""The Offspring"""
175,LAL,"       I do not want to be different,   Father.","""The Offspring"""
176,DATA,"   Doctor, I require your advice as   a successful parent.","""The Offspring"""
177,BEVERLY,"       Well, thank you, Data. I'd like   to think I am. Sit down. How's   Lal?","""The Offspring"""

179,BEVERLY,   Is it lonely for her?,"""The Offspring"""

181,BEVERLY,   Sounds familiar.,"""The Offspring"""
182,DATA,"   Yes, Doctor. It is an experience   I know too well. But I do not   know how to help her. Lal is   passing into sentience. It is   perhaps the most difficult stage   of development for her.","""The Offspring"""
183,BEVERLY,"   It's also a very human   development, Data. As our minds   and bodies grow, sometimes   quite rapidly, we get confused   too... we look around and try to   see how we fit in...       When Wesley was growing up, he   was an extraordinarily bright   boy... but he had a hard time   making friends. The other   children were a little intimidated   by him.","""The Offspring"""
184,DATA,       That is precisely what happened   to Lal at school. How did you   help him?,"""The Offspring"""
185,BEVERLY,"   Well, first I had to go back into   my own childhood and remember how   painful it was for me. Because   there was a time when I didn't   feel very popular either. When   I told that to Wesley, it made   him feel a little better. He knew   I understood what he was going   through.","""The Offspring"""
186,DATA,       I have not told Lal how difficult   it was for me to assimilate. I   did not want it to discourage her.   Perhaps this was an error of   judgement.,"""The Offspring"""
187,BEVERLY,"   You had no one with experience   to help you through sentience.   At least, she has you. Just help   her realize that she's not alone.   Be there to nurture her when she   needs love and attention.","""The Offspring"""
188,DATA,"   I can give her attention, doctor.   But I am incapable of giving her   love.","""The Offspring"""

259,DATA,"   I have asked myself that many   times as I have struggled to be   more human, Lal. Until I finally   realized that it is the struggle   itself that is most important.

267,PICARD,"   It need not be difficult at all.   I understand your concerns. What   I'm asking for is time, patience.   If you keep an open mind, I know   you'll see it is imperative to   keep Data and Lal together. At   least for the formative stages   of her development. After that,   I'm sure that Commander Data will   be delighted to deliver her to   Starfleet Research.","""The Offspring"""
268,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,"   Not satisfactory. If mistakes   are made during the formative   stages, the damage might be   irreparable.","""The Offspring"""

270,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,"   Really, Captain... is this about   breaking up a family... Rather   a sentimental attitude to take   toward androids, isn't it?","""The Offspring"""
271,PICARD,"   They are living, sentient beings.   Their rights and privileges in   our society have been defined.   I helped define them.","""The Offspring"""
272,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,"   Yes, yes... I'm more than willing   to acknowledge that. And you must   acknowledge that Lal may be a   technological step forward in the   development of artificial   intelligence.","""The Offspring"""
273,PICARD,   A most significant step.,"""The Offspring"""
274,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,   And work like this demands   strictly controlled procedures.,"""The Offspring"""
275,PICARD,   Which Commander Data is following.,"""The Offspring"""
276,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,   In effective isolation. And that   is unacceptable to Starfleet   Research.,"""The Offspring"""
277,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,"   This is not personal, Captain.   There are very real dangers here.   Without peer review, Starfleet   feels we're risking another M-5   catastrophe.","""The Offspring"""
278,PICARD,"   That is a forced parallel, Admiral.   M-5 was a battle computer.","""The Offspring"""
279,HAFTEL,"   With an artificial intelligence,   that led to disaster.     ","""The Offspring"""
280,,,"""The Offspring"""
281,ADMIRAL HAFTEL ,   Does this new android have the   same dangerous potential? I don't   know. And that is my point. The   blame of the M-5 catastrophe can   be laid entirely on the fact that   Doctor Daystrom was working in   effective isolation. And that   cannot be permitted to happen   again.,"""The Offspring"""
282,PICARD,"   I respect the need for peer review   and control precautions. I would   submit that you will find them   here aboard the Enterprise. My   crew has served for years with   Data. Unlike your research   people, we have enough such   experience to reliably judge what   is ""normal"" and ""abnormal""   behavior for Soong-type androids.   We are uniquely qualified to   assist in guiding Lal's   development.","""The Offspring"""
283,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,"       That is what I'm here to decide,   Captain.","""The Offspring"""
284,DATA,   So Lal now possesses the sum of   my programming.,"""The Offspring"""
285,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,   Her neural nets are laid down   identically to yours?,"""The Offspring"""
286,DATA,   There do seem to be variations   on the quantum level. Lal can use   contractions... I cannot.,"""The Offspring"""
287,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,   An aberration... what have you   done about it?,"""The Offspring"""
288,DATA,"   I have maintained records on   positronic matrix activity,   behavioral norms, and all verbal   patterns... I have seen no   evidence of other aberrations...","""The Offspring"""
289,PICARD,"   It would seem that you have   actually improved upon yourself,   Data.","""The Offspring"""
290,DATA,"   Is that not the goal of every   parent, sir?","""The Offspring"""
291,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,"   But... as a good... father...   don't you think it would be   better, especially in light of   this aberration, if Lal could be   close to the best possible   equipment and the best-trained   minds to perform diagnostic,   evaluative and repair procedures?","""The Offspring"""
292,DATA,"   I have been programmed with all   the procedures you have mentioned.   And in any meaningful evaluation   of Lal, you would require a model   for a basis of comparison. I am   the only model available, Admiral.","""The Offspring"""
293,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,"   You haven't mastered human   cultural and behavioral norms   yourself yet, have you?","""The Offspring"""
294,DATA,   Nosir.,"""The Offspring"""
295,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,"   Then, if the object of Lal's   existence is for her to understand   human behavior, wouldn't you admit   that you are an imperfect   teacher... in fact, she may choose   to emulate you rather than   humans... even if you instruct   her otherwise.","""The Offspring"""
296,PICARD,"    (cutting off a chance     for Data to reply)   On the other hand, Admiral, how   many of your researchers are   androids? None. And I would   suggest that many aspects of Lal's   existence and development may be   so alien to human experience that   your people simply could not be   made to comprehend them.","""The Offspring"""
297,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,   Where is Lal now?,"""The Offspring"""
298,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,   This is your idea of appropriate   guidance...,"""The Offspring"""
299,DATA,   It is an opportunity for her to   observe human behavior and more   importantly to interact with her   crewmates.,"""The Offspring"""
300,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,   She's capable of running over   sixty trillion calculations per   second and you have her working as   a cocktail waitress.,"""The Offspring"""
301,PICARD,"   Admiral, she is working under the   strict guidance of a woman in   whom I have absolute trust.   Ten-Forward is the center of the   ship's social activity. Everyone   on board comes here...","""The Offspring"""
302,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,   I'm not convinced the sort of   behavior she observes here will   be a positive influence.,"""The Offspring"""
303,GUINAN ,"   My customers usually behave   themselves... if not, they're   asked to leave. There's something   to learn from that as well,   wouldn't you say?","""The Offspring"""
304,PICARD,"   Admiral Haftel, Guinan. She runs   Ten-Forward.","""The Offspring"""
305,PICARD,"   How is Lal doing, Guinan?","""The Offspring"""
306,GUINAN,   She spills a few drinks like the   rest of us. But she's learning   a lot.,"""The Offspring"""
307,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,"       I'm sorry, this is just   outrageous.","""The Offspring"""
308,GUINAN,"   Come now, Admiral, I'm sure you've   been in a few bars in your day...","""The Offspring"""
309,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,   I want the android out of here...   have her report to me immediately   for an interview.,"""The Offspring"""
310,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,"   Well, I've been looking forward   to meeting you, Lal.","""The Offspring"""
311,LAL,   Why?,"""The Offspring"""
312,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,   You're very important to us at   Starfleet Research. We've got   quite a facility at Galor Four.   I'd like to show it to you.,"""The Offspring"""
313,PICARD,"   The Admiral is in fact suggesting   you be moved to Galor Four, Lal.","""The Offspring"""
314,LAL,   Have I done something wrong?,"""The Offspring"""
315,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,"   Not at all. But it is important   to broaden your experiences. And   there's just so much you can learn   aboard a starship, wouldn't you   agree?","""The Offspring"""
316,LAL,"   Yes, I'd agree.","""The Offspring"""
317,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,   Good.,"""The Offspring"""
318,LAL,"   Thus, the natural conclusion would   be when I have learned all there   is to learn aboard the starship,   I would relocate to Galor Four.","""The Offspring"""
319,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,   I don't agree. That is not the   natural conclusion here.,"""The Offspring"""
320,LAL,   I believe it is.,"""The Offspring"""
321,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,"   You see, she resists alternative   suggestions to her own father's   wishes. That's not a good sign.","""The Offspring"""
322,LAL,"   Excuse me, sir, I do not know my   father's wishes.","""The Offspring"""
323,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,"   He did not ""warn"" you about this   conversation?","""The Offspring"""
324,LAL,"   Warn me? No, Admiral. He told me   to answer your questions.","""The Offspring"""
325,PICARD,   The admiral is concerned that you   need more guidance than your   father can provide here on the   Enterprise.,"""The Offspring"""
326,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,   Do not misunderstand. I have   great respect for your... father.,"""The Offspring"""
327,LAL,   You do not speak with respect.,"""The Offspring"""
328,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,       I find her very adversarial.,"""The Offspring"""
329,LAL,"   I am only stating a fact, Admiral.","""The Offspring"""
330,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,"   Apparently, your father has not   taught you about selective   judgment in verbalizing your   thoughts. This is a skill we can   help you develop.","""The Offspring"""
331,LAL,"   My father is already helping me,   sir.","""The Offspring"""
332,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,"   Yes, well, the question is whether   he's helping you enough.","""The Offspring"""
333,LAL,"   Are you asking me, sir?","""The Offspring"""
334,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,"   No, I didn't mean...","""The Offspring"""
335,PICARD,"   Why don't we, Admiral? In all   these discussions, we've never   once mentioned Lal's wishes.   She's a free, sentient being.   What are your wishes, Lal?","""The Offspring"""

337,PICARD,   Thank you. You're excused.,"""The Offspring"""

343,TROI,   I don't know.,"""The Offspring"""
344,LAL,   This is what it means to feel.       This is what it means to feel.,"""The Offspring"""
345,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,"   Commander, you have Lal off to   a wonderful start in life. And   that's what being a parent is all   about. But I have decided I must   ask you to release her to me.","""The Offspring"""
346,DATA,"   May I know why, sir?","""The Offspring"""
347,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,"   All the other arguments aside,   there is one that is irrefutable.   There are only two Soong-type   androids in existence. It is far   too dangerous to have the two of   you in one place. Especially on   a starship. One lucky shot by   some Romulan and we lose you both.","""The Offspring"""
348,PICARD,"   That's a fine argument, Admiral.   But it doesn't change my feeling   that the proper place for Lal to   develop is by Data's side.","""The Offspring"""
349,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,"   You're not a parent, Captain.   I am. I've learned, with   difficulty, that there's a time   when...    (including himself with     Data)   ... all parents have to let go of   our children... for their own   good.","""The Offspring"""
350,PICARD,"   This is not that time. The   umbilical cord is virtually uncut.   The child...    (and this is the first    time that Picard uses    the word ""child""    comfortably, and he    realizes it).   ... the child depends on him.","""The Offspring"""
351,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,"   Mister Data, it would be much   better for Lal if she left knowing   you had voluntarily decided this   was the best course of action.","""The Offspring"""
352,DATA,"   Admiral, when I created Lal, it   was with the hope that someday   she would choose to enter the   Academy and become a member of   Starfleet. I wanted to give   something back in return for all   Starfleet has given me. I still   do. But Lal is my child. You   ask that I volunteer to give her   up. I cannot. That would   violate every lesson I have   learned about human parenting.       As Captain Picard told me after   he first met her, I have taken   on ""quite a responsibility."" I   have brought a new life into this   world. It is my duty, not   Starfleet's, to guide her through   these first difficult steps to   maturity, to support her as she   learns, to prepare her to be a   contributing member of society.   No one can relieve me of that   obligation. And I cannot ignore   it. I am her father.","""The Offspring"""
353,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,"   Then, Mister Data, I regret that   I must order you to transport Lal   aboard my ship.","""The Offspring"""
354,PICARD,"   Belay that order, Commander.","""The Offspring"""

358,PICARD,"   Hold your ground, Mister Data.","""The Offspring"""
359,ADMIRAL HAFTEL,"   Do you understand you're risking   your command and your career,   Captain?","""The Offspring"""
360,PICARD,"   There are times, sir, when men   of good conscience cannot blindly   follow orders. You acknowledge   they are sentient, but ignore   their personal liberty and   freedom. Order a man to turn his   child over to the state? Not   while I am his captain. If you   wish, the Enterprise is prepared   to accompany you to Starfleet   Command and then we'll see what...","""The Offspring"""
