2,WESLEY,   Mom... you know that's not why I   asked for my own quarters this --,"""Journey's End"""

37,PICARD,"   Admiral, may I offer you some --","""Journey's End"""
38,NECHEYEV,"       I'll come right to the point,   Captain. A situation has   developed on the Cardassian border   that...","""Journey's End"""
39,NECHEYEV,   Are those... Bularian canapes?,"""Journey's End"""
40,PICARD,"   Yes, as a matter of fact. I took   the liberty of speaking to your   aide, Commander Wrightwell... he   said you were quite fond of them.","""Journey's End"""
41,NECHEYEV,"   That was very... thoughtful,   Captain. Thank you.","""Journey's End"""
42,PICARD,   You were saying something about   the Cardassians I believe...,"""Journey's End"""
43,NECHEYEV,   Yes. The Federation has just   completed a very long and   difficult series of negotiations   regarding the final status of our   border with the Cardassians.,"""Journey's End"""
44,NECHEYEV,"       These will be the official   boundaries... you'll notice that   a demilitarized zone has also been   created along the border. Neither   side will be permitted to place   military outposts, conduct fleet   exercises, or station warships   anywhere in the demilitarized   area.","""Journey's End"""
45,PICARD,       This border will put several   Federation colonies in Cardassian   territory... and some Cardassian   colonies in ours.,"""Journey's End"""
46,NECHEYEV,"   The agreement is by no means   perfect... neither side got   everything they wanted... but   everyone got something. And as   someone once said, diplomacy is   the art of the possible.       Those colonies finding themselves   on the wrong side of the border   will have to be moved.","""Journey's End"""
47,PICARD,   The colonists are not going to be   very happy about that... some of   them have been there for decades.,"""Journey's End"""
48,NECHEYEV,   It won't be easy... but it is a   reasonable price to pay for peace.       Your mission is to evacuate the   colony on Dorvan Five.,"""Journey's End"""
49,PICARD,"   Dorvan Five... that's where the   group of North American Indians   has settled, isn't it?","""Journey's End"""
50,NECHEYEV,   Yes. They've been there for about   twenty years... they've   established a village in a small   valley on the southern continent.,"""Journey's End"""
51,NECHEYEV,   Is there something wrong?,"""Journey's End"""
52,PICARD,"       Admiral... centuries ago, the   North American Indians were   forcibly displaced from their   ancestral lands. This group on   Dorvan Five originally left Earth   two hundred years ago because they   wanted to preserve their cultural   identities.","""Journey's End"""
53,NECHEYEV,       I am aware of that Captain...,"""Journey's End"""
54,PICARD,"   There are certain... disturbing   historical parallels here. Once   again, these people are being   asked to leave their homes because   of political decisions made by a   distant government.","""Journey's End"""
55,NECHEYEV,"   An Indian representative was   included in the deliberations of   the Federation Council. His   objections were noted,   discussed... but ultimately   rejected.","""Journey's End"""
56,NECHEYEV,"       Captain, the Indians colonized   Dorvan only twenty years ago...   and at that time they were warned   the planet was hotly disputed by   the Cardassians. The bottom line   is... they never should have   settled there in the first place.","""Journey's End"""
57,PICARD,   Then perhaps we should not have   allowed them to settle the planet   originally. But to go to them   twenty years later and ask them to   leave what is now their home...,"""Journey's End"""
58,NECHEYEV,   I made the same argument to the   Federation Council. But it took   three years to negotiate this   treaty... some concessions had to   be made... and this is one of   them.,"""Journey's End"""
59,PICARD,   What if the Indians should...   refuse to evacuate?,"""Journey's End"""
60,NECHEYEV,       Then your orders are to remove   them... by any means necessary.,"""Journey's End"""
61,NECHEYEV,"       I understand your... moral   objections, Captain. If you   wish... I can find someone else to   command the Enterprise for this   mission.","""Journey's End"""
62,PICARD,   No. That won't be necessary.,"""Journey's End"""
63,NECHEYEV,   I don't envy you this task... but   I do believe it is for the greater   good.,"""Journey's End"""
64,PICARD,   I understand.,"""Journey's End"""
65,NECHEYEV,"   And... thank you for...    (beat, looks down at the     food & tea)   ... making me feel welcome.","""Journey's End"""

76,WESLEY,"   Fine, I guess.","""Journey's End"""
77,PICARD,   You guess?,"""Journey's End"""
78,WESLEY,"   I haven't seen him in a while.       To be honest, sir... Boothby was   starting to get on my nerves a   little bit.     ","""Journey's End"""
79,,,"""Journey's End"""
80,WESLEY ,"   He always seemed to have an   opinion about everything.    (then tries to     backtrack)   I mean, I know he's a very...   insightful... intelligent man...","""Journey's End"""
81,PICARD,   But you'd had enough of his   insights.,"""Journey's End"""
82,WESLEY,"   That's not quite what I meant,   sir.","""Journey's End"""

85,GEORDI,   Wes -- there you are. You've got   to take a look at this.,"""Journey's End"""

87,WESLEY,       You've only got one micro-fusion   inter-relay in here... the   converter interface will never   hold up.,"""Journey's End"""
88,GEORDI,"   Hey, I ran the diagnostics myself.   This little baby will withstand   over five hundred Cochranes of   warp field stress.","""Journey's End"""
89,WESLEY,"   I don't think so. You better put   a secondary phase inverter in   there.    (beat, pokes around in     panel)   In fact, this entire subprocessor   matrix needs an overhaul.","""Journey's End"""
90,GEORDI,"   Well, I guess we can't have all   the fancy new equipment they give   you kids at the Academy. We have   to make do with what we've got.","""Journey's End"""
91,WESLEY,   Read the latest paper by Doctor   Vassbinder... he has some   brilliant new theories on warp   propulsion inter-relays.       A lot of this stuff is almost   obsolete.,"""Journey's End"""
92,GEORDI,   What's wrong with you?,"""Journey's End"""
93,WESLEY,       Do you want my help or not?,"""Journey's End"""
94,GEORDI,       I was doing this for you... I   thought you'd be interested in   this.,"""Journey's End"""
95,WESLEY,"   Well, I'm not.","""Journey's End"""
96,PICARD ,   Captain's Log: Supplemental. The   Enterprise has arrived at Dorvan   Five and I have spoken to the   Leader of the Tribal Council. He   has agreed to meet with us this   afternoon to discuss the   situation.,"""Journey's End"""
97,CUT TO:,,"""Journey's End"""
98,PICARD,   Anthwara... I am afraid there is   very little I can do. The   decision regarding this planet was   made at the highest levels of the   Federation.,"""Journey's End"""
99,WAKASA,   A decision that was made over our   explicit objections.,"""Journey's End"""
100,PICARD,"   I must point out that when you   first came to this world, you were   warned that it was the subject of   a dispute between the Federation   and the Cardassians. You were   asked not to settle here.","""Journey's End"""
101,WAKASA,       Do you know how long we have   searched for a home? Almost two   hundred years. Then we found this   world... Can you blame us for not   wanting to give it up?,"""Journey's End"""
102,PICARD,   I understand and respect the long   journey of your people. But I   believe we can help you find a new   home.,"""Journey's End"""
103,TROI,"   As you can see, there are three   other planets in this sector that   have environmental conditions   similar to those here on Dorvan   Five. They are all uninhabited...   and could be colonized   immediately.","""Journey's End"""
104,PICARD,"   And if those worlds don't meet   with your approval, then we'll   find you other choices.","""Journey's End"""
105,ANTHARWA,"   You don't understand... the choice   of this world was not limited   to... ""environmental conditions.""   There were other... more   intangible concerns as well.       My people have always had an...   intimate bond with nature. We   think of ourselves as being a part   of it... and it being a part of   us. One of the reasons our   ancestors left Earth two hundred   years ago was because that bond   had been severed.","""Journey's End"""
106,WAKASA,       They began to control the weather.,"""Journey's End"""
107,ANTHWARA,"   We believe -- very strongly --   that nature should not be ""fixed""   or controlled. Droughts and   floods... tornadoes and   hurricanes... these are natural   events. By putting man above   nature... an imbalance was   created. We could no longer live   in harmony with our environment.","""Journey's End"""
108,PICARD,   I can assure you that we will not   impose a weather control system or   anything else on your people.   Whatever world you choose to   colonize will be completely yours   to do with as you please.,"""Journey's End"""
109,ANTHWARA,"   Captain, once the bond between us   and Earth had been broken, we had   to find a planet where we could   establish a new bond... a planet   that would welcome us. When I   came here twenty years ago, I was   welcomed by the mountains... the   rivers... the sky.","""Journey's End"""
110,WAKASA,"    (to Anthwara, re:     Picard)   He's laughing at you, Anthwara.   He thinks you're talking about old   superstition and nonsense.","""Journey's End"""
111,PICARD,   That's not true. I have a great   deal of respect for your beliefs   and the meaning they hold for your   people.,"""Journey's End"""
112,ANTHWARA,   Then you should respect the fact   that this planet holds a deeply   spiritual significance for us. It   took us two centuries to find a   place where the mountains gave us   permission to use their stone for   our houses... where the rivers let   us drink from their waters... and   where the wind sang to us at   night.       We don't want to spend another two   hundred years searching for what   we already have.,"""Journey's End"""
113,TROI,"   Captain, may I suggest that we   adjourn for now... allow us all   time to think about what's been   said.","""Journey's End"""
114,ANTHWARA,   Agreed. We will reconvene   tomorrow.,"""Journey's End"""
115,PICARD,"   In the meantime, I would like to   invite you all to the Enterprise   this evening as our guests.","""Journey's End"""
116,ANTHWARA,"       Thank you, Captain. We look   forward to it.","""Journey's End"""
117,CUT TO:,,"""Journey's End"""
118,BEVERLY,"   Ever since you came aboard you've   been moody, sullen and rude. I   want to know what's going on.","""Journey's End"""
119,WESLEY,"   Nothing's going on, Mom. I just   want to be left alone.","""Journey's End"""
120,BEVERLY,"   No, that's not good enough. Your   behavior in Engineering was   inexcusable.","""Journey's End"""
121,WESLEY,"   Well, then that's my business   isn't it? I don't need you   telling me how to behave.","""Journey's End"""
122,BEVERLY,   I shouldn't have to -- you're a   fourth year Starfleet cadet.   You're expected to have a certain   level of maturity.,"""Journey's End"""
123,WESLEY,   Maybe I'm sick of living up to   other people's expectations...   maybe I'm sick of following rules   and regulations... did you ever   think about that?,"""Journey's End"""
124,CUT TO:,,"""Journey's End"""
125,PICARD,   ... so I've been trying to   familiarize myself with the   history and traditions of your   people. I was quite interested to   learn that it was your grandfather --   Katowa -- who led the group of   Indians who initially left Earth   two centuries ago.,"""Journey's End"""
126,ANTHWARA,"       He was a... great man. When I was   a little boy, I was so proud to   know that he was my grandfather.   In fact, I think I was a little   too proud of it... I remember the   other children getting tired of   hearing me talk about him.","""Journey's End"""
127,PICARD,   It must have been a very difficult   decision for your grandfather to   make... uprooting your people...   leading them into the unknown for   an undetermined amount of time...   not even knowing if you ever would   find a new home.,"""Journey's End"""
128,ANTHWARA,   There was great deal of   opposition. Even my own father   was against it... but when Katowa   made his decision -- that was it.   My father never said another word.,"""Journey's End"""
129,PICARD,       It's never easy to leave one's   home... to give up the safe and   familiar. But there are times   when the greater good demands that   sacrifices be made... I'm sure   your grandfather knew that.,"""Journey's End"""
130,ANTHWARA,       His grandson does too. But there   are also times when a people have   sacrificed too much... when they   must hold on to what they have...   even if it means standing up   against overwhelming opposition.,"""Journey's End"""
131,ANTHWARA,"   What do you know about your   family, Captain?","""Journey's End"""
132,PICARD,   A great deal actually. My father   was a strong believer in passing   along the family history and   traditions.,"""Journey's End"""
133,ANTHWARA,"   Tell me about your family. We   have very strong ties to our   ancestors... we believe their   actions guide us even now.   Knowing more about your family   might help me to better understand   you.       Besides, it's always a good idea   to understand your opponent in any   negotiation.","""Journey's End"""
134,PICARD,"       I hope that by the end of this   matter, you won't look at me as   your opponent.       My family. Well... our roots in   Western Europe go back to the time   of Charlemagne.","""Journey's End"""
135,WESLEY,       Sorry I'm late.,"""Journey's End"""
136,BEVERLY,   We'll talk about that later.,"""Journey's End"""
137,LAKANTA,   Wesley Crusher?,"""Journey's End"""
138,WESLEY,   Yes?,"""Journey's End"""
139,LAKANTA,   I am Lakanta.,"""Journey's End"""
140,WESLEY,   I'm... glad to meet you... can I   get you a drink or --,"""Journey's End"""

144,WESLEY,   I'm... not sure what you mean.,"""Journey's End"""
145,LAKANTA,"   Two years ago, I went into the   Habak and began a vision quest.   While I was there, I saw many   things... talked to many animals   and spirits... and I saw you.","""Journey's End"""
146,LAKANTA,       There're many things you don't   understand yet... but you will.,"""Journey's End"""
147,WESLEY,"   I don't mean to be rude, but I   wish you'd stop talking about me   in the future tense.","""Journey's End"""
148,LAKANTA,"   I know your spirit's troubled,   Wesley. That's why you've come to   us. We can help you find the   answers you seek.","""Journey's End"""
149,BEVERLY,"   I just don't know what to do, Jean-Luc.   It's as if someone took my   son away and left this stranger in   his place.","""Journey's End"""
150,PICARD,"   In a sense, that's exactly what's   happened. Wesley left here three   years ago as a boy... but now he's   a young man. That can't be an   easy transition for a mother... or   a son.","""Journey's End"""
151,BEVERLY,"   Well, it's gone beyond just the   two of us...","""Journey's End"""
152,PICARD,   I heard about the incident with   Geordi.,"""Journey's End"""
153,BEVERLY,"   Have you heard about the Academy?       I called Admiral Brand this   afternoon. She said his grades   are falling... he's becoming   remote, defensive... if he's not   careful, he'll wash out next term.","""Journey's End"""

156,PICARD ,"       Oh, yes. I nearly washed out my   sophomore year... there were a lot   of different factors... my   father's death... a teenage love   affair with the wrong girl... the   point is, I realized what was   happening to me and I pulled   myself out of it. I'm sure Wesley   will do the same.","""Journey's End"""
157,BEVERLY,   Jean-Luc... will you have a talk   with him? Maybe this is the kind   of thing a boy -- a young man has   to discuss with another man.,"""Journey's End"""

159,BEVERLY,   But he needs help.,"""Journey's End"""
160,PICARD,"   Perhaps. But he has to want that   help. If he doesn't, then any   effort on our part might only push   him further away.","""Journey's End"""

169,WESLEY,       What questions? I don't even know   why I came here.,"""Journey's End"""
170,LAKANTA,   I told you before your spirit was   troubled. Was I wrong?,"""Journey's End"""
171,WESLEY,"       I don't know about my... spirit,   but I guess you could say I'm a   little... troubled.","""Journey's End"""
172,LAKANTA,   Then perhaps you do have questions   to be answered. Maybe your   answers are here... maybe they're   not. Will it hurt to look?,"""Journey's End"""
173,WESLEY,   Tell me about this... Habak. You   said you had some kind of a vision   there?,"""Journey's End"""
174,LAKANTA,   The Habak is a holy place... we   hold many of our rituals and   ceremonies there. It's sacred to   us.,"""Journey's End"""

180,LAKANTA,"   Everything is sacred to us. The   buildings... the food... the   sky... the dirt under your   feet... and you. Whether you   believe in your own spirit or   not... we believe in it. So you   are a sacred person here, Wesley.","""Journey's End"""
181,WESLEY,   I think that's the first time   anyone's used that particular word   to describe me.,"""Journey's End"""
182,LAKANTA,   So if you're sacred... then you   have to treat yourself with   respect... to do otherwise is to   desecrate something holy.,"""Journey's End"""
183,WESLEY,   Is that... what you think I'm   doing?,"""Journey's End"""
184,LAKANTA,   Only you can decide that.,"""Journey's End"""
